I have to take advantage of the occasion, of course, bear to insist on the urgent need to review the relative directives to the equality of deal among men and women in the legal and professional diets of social security with the end to seat the bases of the individualisation of the rights of pension, to fix an age of retirement flexible bear men and women, to regulate the rights of the survivors and of the spouses divorced in the cast of the rights of pension purchased during the marriage, and, finally, to guarantee an independent social security to those spouses that help to autonomous workers in the sector of the craftsmanship, the trade, the agriculture and the liberal professions.
By it that refers  to the internal politics, the European Parliament, by means of his proposal, reinforces the programs of action directed to the defence of the environment, the promotion of the renewable energies, the protection of the consumers, the exchange among schools, the recovery of the historical heritage, the social integration of the professional or social groups with specific difficulties, the equality among men and women, the paper of the no governmental organisations, the promotion of the employment, the support to the small and medium enterprises, etc.
Thus, insist in a series of subjects that have gone  posing in the last years, like the need to delete the barriers and the protections that still exist in key sectors of our economy, to increase the levels of knowledge, of education, especially by it that takes reference to technical educations and professional training, to reduce the fetters that exist, especially from the point of sight fiscal, to the creation of new places of work and to contemplate the possibility to modify the tax on the value added, the VAT, to base to reduce it in those sectors that occupy more put of work -it that calls  intensive sectors in hand of drama-.
Regarding the field of application of the lines of performance of the program and taking into account the possibilities that offers Internet for the industrial and economic activities, and of indirect form for the sector of the employment, proposes  the adoption of a wider approach with the end that, further of the subjects that affect to the minors of age or to the human dignity, examine  also the possibilities that offers the program of action for the protection of the economic and industrial activities.
Regarding the budgetary lines for the that has not adopted  neither neither has proposed  at least a juridical base, the Council has taken note of the will of the Commission to fulfil the previous commitments to 10 June 1998 and to examine the appeals that in this moment still have not culminated with the formal establishment of an agreement, procuring avert any possible derivative discrimination of the concrete terms of processing of the files.
The Commission proposes to contribute to this tendency contributing his cooperation in fields so diverse like the development of the human resources, the administrative reform, the social protection, the reform of the financial sector, the fight against the poverty and the regional disparities, the transfer of knowledges technical in the field of the energy, the enlargement of the scientific and technical cooperation and the protection of the environment.

In the economic and social plane, the axes of action tackle the restructuring of the companies, the public finances, the banking system or the accesses to the international financial markets, the norms and the certification, the politics of competition, the access to the market, the technological cooperation and the development of the agricultural reform and the social dialogue.
Third: therefore, it is justified a strengthening of the measures and of the helps of nature horizontal and related with the territory, the environment, the forests, the diversification of the productive tissue of the most dependent zones of the agriculture, the promotion of the quality and the valorisation of the regional products, the animal and vegetal health, the links with the employment and with the disadvantaged zones.
Like President of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture, want to work together with the Commission so that the protection of the environment in the agricultural politics have a still greater weight, that the States members and the regions have a greater influence in the configuration of the agricultural politics and in the rural areas and that the protection of the animals and a preventive protection of the consumers happen to form integral part of the common agricultural politics.
The new economic frame of the resultant European Union of the realisation of the Only Market and of the new monetary politics, in brief in stage of execution, takes that it earn every time greater importance the interaction among economic politics and social politics, when stressing the need to consolidate the relations among the Economic and Monetary Union, the Only Market, the politics of cohesion and a social politics and of effective employment.
Lady Speaker, the opinion of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics on this subject aspires, through the amendments presented, to boost the development and the adoption of systems technical profitable with the main goal to protect to the minors of age and the human dignity and, especially, to reinforce the protection of the economic and business activities.
It suits to stand out that, in spite of the worry for consecrating relative principles to the respect of the rights, the freedoms and the guarantees in this particularly delicate sphere and to the need to adopt measures that comport cooperation, as, for example, in the fight against the delinquency organised and the bleaching of capitals, the traffic of drug and of arms, the traffic of human beings, it will be necessary to loan particular attention to the coherence and the consequences of the politics and measures sure enough adopted.
Insisting in the excellent exhibition that has taken the speaker and that, besides, is not more that the colophon of the form in the that has carried this complicated and controversial report, want to stand out, in the first place, that the favourable vote of the Group of the Popular Party European, and do not doubt that the of the majority of the Assembly tomorrow, is in a demonstration of confidence in front of the Court and those who integrate it, since our competition only reaches to issue report on the modification of the separated chamber of the article 2 of the decision of the Council.

Apart from his strictly economic meaning, that do not leaves to be great, these institutions have offered to our villages the real proof that the creation of new community institutions attendants of the exercise of a politics integrated in the place of the governments or of the national institutions of the States members do not constitutes a betrayal, but a conjoint exercise more effective of our national sovereignty.
The application of the guidelines allocated to open the markets to the notorious competition and to the suppression, by any half, of the state agents, joined to the logic of the reduction, to any price, of the cost of operation in sectors like the of the aerial and rail transports have conducted to the rape of the conjoint agreements, no only regarding the time of work, but also regarding the remaining conditions of work.
The report is in it true when underlining the need to establish a narrower coordination among the great orientations of economic politics and the guidelines in matter of politics of employment, taking into account the need of a coherent strategy for the employment, the growth, the stability and the economic reforms and for an improvement of his content and his opportunity and the relation among the commissions of the Council interested.

In this frame, the forecast of measures of a high social protection of the workers in the bunch is especially important, as long as it involve an improvement of the conditions of work, a strict observance of the disposals of protection, the support to the labour collective agreements, the reduction of the time of work without decrease of the wages.

No, it do not is necessary to dissemble the amplitude of the crisis; his immediate causes have to, on the other hand, identify correctly, and especially the singular responsibility of a Parliament that, dominated by the communists, has blocked the preparation of the indispensable legislative frame for the instauration of a State of right.
Sure enough, we have to comprise fully the consequences of the current events and recognise the failure of concepts of development based purely in the free market, with an invisible hand that introduces the emergent economies in the world-wide capitalism with an extremely reduced cost for the rich countries.
The Commission is collecting at present information of his representatives to form  a complete image of the existent risk and to continue the reflection on the need and the feasibility of the establishment to level of the Union of some basic ethical requirements.

Gentleman President, the set up of the Economic and Monetary Union and, therefore, the assumption by part of the Central Bank European of the monetary politics, coincides with a period of disorders and pressures of the currencies that want to believe that they are transitory but, when seeming, do not constitute an isolated phenomenon but, in some mood, general that has to be confronted of consistent and accurate way.
This budget is contemplated in the public opinion with special interest as it represents almost the half of the budget of the European Union and because, lamentably, in the past no always has respected  sufficiently the budgetary principle of an economic employment and regulate of the pertinent money of the taxes.
The report underlines the need of the strengthening of the legislative frame, in particular in the spheres of the organisation of the work, of the individual rights and communities of the workers and of the social measures allocated to regulate the free economy of market.

Because of the reform of the financial system of the EU and to the reductions of the structural Bottoms and the Bottoms of cohesion for some countries, of compliance with the package of reforms of the Diary 2000, is fundamental that find new roads of finance of these so necessary projects.

Finally, in the Green Book on the introduction of the only coin, the Commission renewed his call to the banks so that they considered to the introduction of the euro like an only opportunity to foresee an only zone of payments, at least by it that refers  to the payments in euros.
