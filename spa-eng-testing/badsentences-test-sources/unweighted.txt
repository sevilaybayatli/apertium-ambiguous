I bill the points very in brief: the reform of the budgetary procedure, with the put to the day of #the same; the extension of the *codecisión budgetary; the integration of the peripheral institutions in the community system; the consolidation of the financial perspectives in form of an authentic financial program to half term; the reform of the system of resources own with the end to ensure the autonomy and the financial efficiency of the Union, by a part, and the transparency of the community budget, by #another, which supposes that there #be *codecisión around the determination of the global level of own resources; the introduction of the possibility to have of fiscal instruments to scale #european; the possibility that the budgetary authority take part #all the years in relation with the mix of the different categories of income; and the extension of the *codecisión legislative and the taking of decisions by qualified majority to the financial regulations in #all the programs or instruments that comport community costs, to the regulations of the *PAC and to #all act that believes an executive agency.
The goals of this proposal are the following: guarantee the existence of the right to the information and the regular query of the workers on the economic and strategic progresses of the company and on the decisions that *les affect in #all the States members of the Union; consolidate the social dialogue and the relation of confidence in the field of the company to end to contribute to the forecast of the risks, the development of the flexibility and of the organisation of the work in the frame of the security, the promotion and the sensitisation of the workers regarding the need of adaptations; include the situation and the promotion of the employment in the company in the subjects of information and query; guarantee that the workers are informed and consulted before they adopt  decisions that #can suppose substantial changes of the organisation of the work and of the contractual relations; guarantee the efficiency of said procedure introducing specific sanctions against #that that break seriously said obligations in these sectors.
How glorious challenges #can *usted confront in name of the Fifteen? Impose like actor to the one hundred by one hundred in Orient Next to contribute to fix a just and durable peace, now possible; *relanzar the negotiations of *Lomé on new bases that integrate the worries of our 71 partners of the south, with the end to save the spirit of this only Convention in the world; take that it hear  a different voice regarding the international financial institutions, for example in favour of the cancellation of the debt of the today blocked countries in his development by this mechanism *infernal; launch a true international crusade in favour of the disarmament, in particular the nuclear, in some moments of enormous danger of proliferation; convert in spokesman, in *portaestandarte of a revaluation of the system of the Nations Joined, of the respect by his Letter, by the promotion of a type of relations international civilised that *destierren for ever the war like half to resolve the differences and in it immediate, by favour, that put end of another form that was not by means of formal communiqués to the inertia *insoportable of the Union in the wild war of *Chechenia.
Like this, I go to refer very in brief the decision that finishes  to take takes #few days for the application of the project on the *risk capital, on the investments of capital of high risk, that the past week approved the Commission and that they are an important tool, mainly for the new small companies, the measures to boost the innovation *interfronteriza; the measures to promote the mobility of the employees by means of the transfer of his rights and of his pensions; special programs for his training and, of course, the exceptional quantity of the structural bottoms for the goal 3, to the that belong #all the countries, a quantity of the order of 24.000 millions of euros for the next seven years, that by means of the goal 3 and by means of the programs of the structural bottoms and, of course, by means of the strategy for the employment, #can structure national and political politics connected to #european level that concern to the *empleabilidad, the operating capacity, the adaptability of the companies and of the workers.
An event like *Tampere, that woke up *tantas expectations, #can seem an end in himself\/hisself same, but only is the beginning of a process. The Commission believes, nevertheless, that *Tampere transmitted the suitable message to #a lot of audiences: to our citizens, in the first place, that a subject *prioritario for his personal interests also wins importance among the political priorities of the Union; to the national administrations, that there #be not gone back backwards and that his own Bosses of Government have engaged  to introduce improvements, included the institutional improvements of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, and to work as it is had to; to the world of the delinquency, that the Union is *movilizando all his potential to combat his activities that are a threat for our freedom and our welfare, and even for our democratic diets; and finally, to the external world, that an inwardly safe Union #do not means a Union fortress and that our commitments with #that that need protection are holy.
Here they find  reports on a resolution of directive of the European Commission that imposes to the States members that adopt the necessary measures so that any society of telecommunications notable in the market #can explode his network of television by wire through #the same juridical person or on the project of a wide project of #french law on the society of the information that, among other things, wants to regulate the questions related with the free employment of keys, the reliability in the traffic of data, of the protection of the rights of author or the necessary instances of regulation; or also, on the last sentences of the European Court of Justice on the Human Rights, with the that they have refused  13 demands against *Turquía, #if well the Court in eleven of the thirteen cases followed to the *demandantes recognising rapes of the right of free expression of opinion.
Now well, of granting in granting, *nos find in the day of today, in name of the logic of the iron of the pact of stability budgetary, in the first place with some estimates and some financial needs for the reconstruction of *Kosovo that have dropped mysteriously of 500 millions of euros -enciphers advanced by the Commission, the World-wide Bank, the States members and the media- to 420, afterwards to some 300 millions; second in front of a reduction of the credits that had voted for *Timor oriental to the equal that for the victims of the earthquake of *Turquía, in *tercer place in front of the cuts in the credits assigned to the cooperation, to the alimentary help, to the help to Palestinian and to the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, to the program *Tacis bear *Europa of the East, to the support to the human rights and finally, confronted to cuts of a total of some 2 *millardos for the credits of payment.
Like chamber point, the global figures also are, obviously, *indicativas of the work made by the commissions and, in particular, by the speakers, and *yo wanted to appreciate, therefore, very sincerely in name of the Commission the report of the Mr. *Virrankoski on the projects of budget for the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Accounts, and the Social Economic Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the report of the Mr. *Pittella on the project of budget operative of the European Community of the Coal and of the Steel, and also very especially the report of the Mr. *Bourlanges. #This shows once again that it is an excellent speaker and a teacher in the presentation of proposals very sophisticated .
On the other hand, the purpose manifested by the Commission -and that also is #worthy of *beneplácito- to elaborate annual reports on the relations of the European Union with *Macao #would not have to dispense to the European Parliament to loan, to his time, the greater attention to this subject, very in particular following regularly his evolution from 20 December, tightening to #that *respecto the exchange of informations and cooperation *interinstitucionales, creating his own group of contact, of mutual links, analysing and debating the periodic reports that  *le present, appreciating, finally, the evolution of #all the looks of the *coyuntura related with *Macao with seen to the transformations of the international relations in the Extreme Orient and of the changes that announce  in this zone, without forgetting the new situations that it #can comport the entrance of Chinese in the *OMC and the evolution *yo qualitative modification of his relations with the States Joined of *América.
. *SV In the plan of action common that the EU and #EE.UU. They signed in *Madrid on 3 December 1995, signal  under the title Reaction in front of global threats the increase of the collaboration in the fight against the illicit trade with drugs, the measures of cooperation among the competent #american authorities and *Europol, the collaboration to give support to the program of drugs of the UN, the coordination of programs of alternative development to combat the preparation of *estupefacientes and the creation of channels of cooperation among community organs as, for example, the European Centre for the Control of Drugs and *Toxicomanías and the #Inter-American Commission for the control of *drogodependencias.
To finalise, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, #if the European Commission wishes really contribute to the development of the naval sector in *Europa, *le suffices with defending clearly the principle of the just trade during the negotiations of the *OMC, leave to the States members the freedom to take part directly in this strategic sector to reorient technologically #some dockyards to segments of market with future, favour the cooperation among the companies to contribute to improve the global efficiency of each #one of our types of dockyards and, finally, in the frame of the common politics of fishing, adopt the decisions that are necessary to make possible a renewal controlled of our fleet *pesquera, the *perpetuación of the experience of our dockyards and the vitality, gentleman President, of our dependent maritime regions of the fishing.
Gentleman President, take note and comprise the point of sight of the committee in his final considerations about that there #be not an only measure that #can treat the problem of the mentality, but believe that a wide and clear strategy of reform, some effective mechanisms to reckon and insist *vigorosamente in the achievement of goals, the quality of the public service and the assessment of the money, the vocational training in the technicians and the ethical of the management, a promotion strictly *meritocrática, some just disciplinary procedures firm and reliable, the continuous emphasis in the professionalism and the #probity in the school and in the services #can *moldear the mentality.
This Parliament has taken a very clear position, since it has predicted that, before the enlargement, have to make  *obligatoriamente #some great institutional reforms #if we want to avert that *Europa convert  only and exclusively in a big zone of *librecambio, prey of an extraordinary capacity of indecision by a regulation and by some obsolete internal rules. It has indicated likewise that they do not suffice the decisions on the vote by majority and the composition of the Commission to give a new impulse and a new strength to *Europa, but that it is necessary to take other paths as, for example, the of the Letter of Rights Fundamental and of #some of the things that had to join #all the big #european movement, logically, inside the respect of the nations, of his feelings, of his history, of his tradition that consider very important.
How new answers contributes *usted to this thirst of resistance that, in front of the career *desenfrenada by the profitability is manifesting  in #all *Europa, for example, in this same moment, in my country, to *través of the enormous movement of charm to the workers of the group *Michelin that finishes to announce 7.500 suppressions of employment in *Europa, after having increased his benefits in a 20 %?How new answers contribute *ustedes to those and to #that that expect that *Europa promote a real dynamics of alternatives to the globalisation of exclusion today in practice, already treat  of employees, of peasants, of literate persons that argue the rules of the world-wide trade, or of two #guinean youngsters victims of the exodus of the misfortune, without an international order that recognise to each human being the right to the life, to the work and to the dignity?
Therefore, I believe that -understanding totally even the narrow current mandate for the Conference in it that concerns to the review of the institutions as a result of the Treaty of *Amsterdam- it is necessary to tackle the necessary reform and in depth of our Court of Justice and of our Court of First Instance, the reform of the nomination of the judges -in the that this Parliament has to have an important participation-, the reform of the cast of competitions among the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, so that the citizen #can have an idea *cabal and clear of #which is this #european justice that also is his direct justice, and the reform, in end -and #that already is of another chapter- of the *justiciabilidad of the acts.
How another thing #can mean the proposals that listen , and that in general are collected in the report, on the changes in the votes of the Council, on the change of the number, or of the competitions, of the commissioners, on the decrease of the popular representation in the *PE after the increase of the number of states of the EU, but the *reforzamiento of the position of the rich countries of the EU, the *reforzamiento of the position of the companies *monopolistas, that in his majority have his headquarters in these countries, the attempt to minimise any resistance of the villages, or even of the countries, to the *antipopulares resolutions of the EU that affect or #can affect even to national interests?
To #that *respecto, have to stand out the principle of the mutual recognition of the decisions and sentences, to the that has to contribute the adoption of definitions and common sanctions in #all the States members against some criminal activities of character *transfronterizo, as, for example, in the spheres of the delinquency organised, of the illicit traffic of drugs, of the traffic of human beings or of the delinquency against the boys; I have to stand out equally the creation of the network *EUROJUST, that is without place to doubts the beginning of the construction of a judicial component of the European Union that it was instrument of support and of control of the action of *EUROPOL with seen to guarantee the inner security and also an instrument of defence of the rights of the #european citizens.
It considers the Council that statements like the effected by the #danish Minister of External Subjects, Mr. *Petersen, the one who affirmed that the decision quoted transmits the correct message that the democracy and the wish of reforms obtain his *recompensa, express the point of sight of the EU and of the designated international community on the respect of the freedoms and the fundamental democratic values, and that the decision of character #blackmailer of *Luxemburgo is a message that promotes the democracy, pushing to a village and his political representatives, by means of the *coacción, to follow practices *antidemocráticas with the end to survive, in place to guarantee the normal democratic operation of the institutions in the next elections?
It takes fault a complete review of the politics of the European Union that include and confront: the democratisation of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade; the support to the familiar model of agriculture; the necessary mechanisms for the *dignificación of the workers of the *Tercer World, so that it do not prejudice  his productive and commercial statute; the protection of the environment; the diffusion of the technology in the poorest countries; the treatment of the international debt of the feeblest countries; the protection of the cultural diversity of the planet in front of the *superpotencia North American of the show.
While this morning a colleague put of self-evident the fact that the three institutions of the European Union managers to sign the budget were chaired by women and saw in this fact #one *figuración of it that it #can represent the *tercer #millenium for the consolidation of the equality of rights and of opportunities man-woman, in *Afganistán see how the #taliban diet no only denies to the woman -to millions of women- the exercise of his more elementary rights -like the rights to the education, to the health or to exert a profession-, no only this diet exerts violence on *ella by the mere fact to be woman but that, with the negation of these rights, *le is also denying the freedom to live his own life, *le is denying his condition of person.
The conflict, amply fed these two weeks, among the Parliament and the Council, do not has to *hacernos forget #some essential questions: regarding the help conceded to the region of *Kosovo, #can *sorprendernos the fact that this help was not conditioned by the definite return to the peace, it that, alas, do not occurs, as it remembers it a recent report of the *OSCE; regarding the amounts assigned, the members of the Commission of Budgets have assisted in the distinct commissions to a true dribble, since the institutions took *malabarismos with the millions of euros, without that nobody have taken  really the work to reckon the needs of the region, since #all said that *Kosovo #can not at present absorb #such amounts, equivalents to the half of his *PNB.
In front of *nosotros are the economic and social challenges arisen as a result of the introduction of the only coin, the realisation of a deep reform of the Institutions and the attribution of a concrete sense to the rights of the citizens; from the point of sight external, a strategic gap of at least ten years that it is necessary to satisfy regarding the dramatic crisis of the *Balcanes, the resumption of a #mediterranean politics backed by the process of peace that has restarted his career, the dramatic crisis of *Rusia, the defence of the human rights and of the minorities of the world.
Gentleman President, since the controversial decision of the #turkish government that debate constitutes a case more of fault of respect and of rape of the right of the sea by part of *Turquía after the known decision of the Big National Assembly Turkish to empower to the #turkish government to consider «*casus *belli» and declare the war to #Grecia in the case that #Grecia exerted his legitimate right to expand the #greek territorial waters in accordance with the convention of the UN that only *Turquía has denied  to sign, ask to the Council #if it proposes  signal also this subject in his request to *Ankara and in the conversations that, during the imminent European Council of *Helsinki, will keep , on the relations of the European Union with *Turquía and on the criteria that #this, as *nos has said the Mr. Minister, will have to fulfil.
Although the proposal of regulation of the Commission began to negotiate  before the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, in the Commission of Subjects Juridical -that approves in general the proposal of regulation, since it goes directed to delay the disarmament of the *arbitrios #canarian and, therefore, has a protective function- think that after the entrance in vigour of the article 299.2 it that proceeds is not a simple *suavización of the limitation of the special treatment but paralyse the elimination of this special treatment because, predictably, in the measures that have to propose the Commission for the regions *ultraperiféricas of compliance with said article 299.2, that foresees special measures in matter of fiscal politics, the Commission will allow predictably a small rearm so as to that the small local industries affected do not result prejudiced.
Along these months, of these last years, consider the article 6 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam the reaffirmation of the weight and of the paper that in the European Union have the principles of freedom, of democracy, of respect of the human rights or, even, the constitution of the International Penal Court or the need that #all warn to give greater strength to the article 7 of the Letter of the Organisation of the Nations Joined with the object to be able to guarantee the respect of the human rights preventing the exercise of the eventual humanitarian interferences to logics that are not linked pure and simply to the respect of said rights: all #this *nos shows that they have made  great progresses.
The first is the greater attention loaned to the access, to the market of work after the process of training; the second is the field of the technology of the information, in the that it takes  a big effort -to the that is not extraneous the imminent initiative of the Commission on the society of the information- for linking the problem of the employment to the computing; the third is the active paper of the local instances -in relation with the *cual urges  and encourages  to the States members to that they recognise a greater specific weight to the municipal authorities-, and, of course, the paper of the social agents.
Report *A5-01031999 of the Mr. *Colom *I Naval, in name of the Commission of Budgets, on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the review of the financial perspectives *anejas to the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 6 May 1999 on the budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure *SEC19991647 - *C5-03221999 and on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the instrument of flexibility point 24 of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 6 May 1999 on the budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure *SEC19991647 - *C5-03141999
#Some examples: *España follows vetoing the creation of the indispensable anonymous societies #european, the Realm Joined protects put of work in *Londres and denies  to accept the fiscal harmonisation, not even regarding the tax on the capitals, *Francia prefers to attend to the community courts before that liberalise his electrical market of the form that establishes the rule of the Union, the #german Chancellor *infringe #all the rules of the economy of market and saves a company of construction in failure to harvest political laurels in his country, the war of the meat of *vacuno against *Inglaterra prolongs , *rebasando the necessary limits from the point of sight sanitary.
The most significant innovations that we want to introduce are the following: the attentive consideration of the consequences of the *morosidad in the payments of the perishable alimentary products; the recognition of the right to demand the *resarcimiento of the derivative costs of the collection of the credit; the clause of reservation of command in favour of the seller; the certainty that an executive title #can be taken effective in the term of 60 days from the date in that the creditor formulate the demand; finally, the greater transparency in the relation among the administration *adjudicadora and the contractor, #as well as in the relation of outsourcing.

Have to remember in brief that in the group presented by the Commission the past year appeared in the first place an amendment to the whole of the directive of 1993, on the that *versa the report of the Mrs. *Smet, a directive on the transport by road that, lamentably, is totally blocked in the Council of Transports in this moment, as have understood; the third, a directive of application of the agreement among the social speakers on the persons of sea, was approved in form of directive in June of this year, by it that this element already is dismissed, and, finally, the proposal of the that go to talk today, a directive on the application of the labour day on board of fuselages that take scale in the ports of the Community.
More specifically, regarding the #french legislation -to the that the Mr. *Rothley has taken reference- #such as it was drafted in the moment of the sentence of 10 January 1995 dictated in the procedure *nº 22993 *Leclerc *Au *blé *vert , the Court of Justice declared that, in the field of a national legislation that establishes a diet of price fixed of the book, are measured of equivalent effect to the restrictions to the import, forbidden by the article 28 ancient article 30 of the Treaty, the norms that, with regard to the sale of books published in #the same Been member affected and *reimportados, previous export to another Been member, force to observe the price of sale imposed by the editor, unless they do not exist founded reasons to consider that said books were exported with the only purpose of his *reimportación allocated to evade said law .
In effect, is necessary the abolition of the internal borders protecting the security of the citizens, the harmonisation regarding the admission and circulation of citizens of third countries inside the European Union, creating a politics of immigration and of asylum more uniform and *solidaria, the coordination of the actions of prevention and the fight against the delinquency and, in particular, the delinquency organised especially, the terrorism, the traffic of human beings, the offences against the boys, the traffic of drug and arms, the corruption and the fraud and, finally, the guarantee in the #european level of the rights and fundamental freedoms.
Without embargo, *yo have the *convencimiento that an event occurred in *Europa finished for giving the last impulse to the Government of Of *Klerk, constituted to finals of 1989, and *le allowed to gather the necessary value to open the doors to a radical change of the system and with *ello to his own disappearance. The fall of the wall of *Berlín, as last visible symbol of the end of a system, in #whose name had not defended  precisely the freedom and the democracy in the *África *Austral, finished with the subjective perception of the *surafricanos white that #if they celebrated  some democratic elections of compliance with the principle *one *man, *one vote, eleven to vote  a man, a vote, an only vote #would finish living another time in a system *monopartidista, and also in an economy *estatalizada, fruit of the expropriation.
For example, the enlargement of the Council General Subjects to the ministers of defence, formula already experienced the past Monday; the set up of a permanent political organ, the *COPS , commissioned to follow #all the relative questions to the external politics and of common security, included the relative to the defence; the set up of a military committee; the creation of a strength of intervention fast of some 50.000 men, etc., etc.; and I do not forget that the #finnish Presidency has conceded #a lot of importance to the improvement of the no military means of security, mainly to preventive title.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00331999 of the Mr. *Harbour in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market on the common position of the Council 869711999 - *C5-00311999 - 19980071 *COD relative to the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive of the Council *70221CEE of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the deposits of fuel liquid and the devices of protection rear of the vehicles to engine and of his trailers.
Second, it is equally desirable and urgent the voluntary participation of the workers in the capital of his company, so much as it indicates it the speaker in his amendment 12 to the guidelines for the employment, and *ello by two reasons. In the first place, by reasons funded relative to the need to improve the endowment of capital own of the companies to resist to the *imposiciones of the great bottoms of investment and protect the employment, but also by a human reason that resides in the evolution of the places of work with future, the *cuales that demand a level of training increasingly high and a personal commitment that only #can  take advantage of and boost intelligently by means of the participation.
Of way more general, do not believes the Commission -seen the situations of #crisis and the increasing threat that represent the numerous diets *antidemocráticos present in this region of the world- that the development of a strategic relation, political, economic and cultural among the EU and the Indian -the most populated democracy of the world- #would allow to join, of significant and exemplary way, in an alone political, the will to establish political and economic relations privileged with the countries governed by the principles and the rules of the democracy and of the State of Right, #as well as economic and commercial interests very understood?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, results *reconfortante that in a so important negotiation like the of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade the fifteen States members have adopted a common position to establish, in the field of the agriculture, some rules of game stable that allow a loyal competition in the world-wide stage and confront with clarity the challenges of the new #millenium, since they have taken  like central base the positions adopted in his day in the diary of the agreement of agriculture of the Round *Uruguay and in the Diary 2000 of *Berlín, #as well as the maintenance *multifuncional of the agriculture.
In relation with the libraries and the promotion of the democracy and the culture, the Council leaves proof that in the article 151 of the Treaty of the Union indicates  that the community efforts to boost the cultural development in the States members, respecting his national and regional diversity, have to orient to boost the collaboration among the States members and, #if it is necessary, support and complete his activities -in the first place- to improve and spread knowledges on the history and the culture of the #european villages -second- to conserve and protect the *acervo cultural that have meant for *Europa -in *tercer place- for cultural exchange no commercial and -in chamber place- for the artistic and literary creation, included the audiovisual sector.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the recommendation *A5-00231999 for the *segunda reading, in name of the Commission of Culture, Education, Media and Sport, on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council 807611999 - *C5-00241999 - *19960130COD, by the that modifies  the Directive of base relative to the program #Socrates with the end to include to *Turquía among the countries *beneficiarios, and on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council 807711999 - *C5-00251999 - *19960131COD, by the that modifies  the Decision of base relative to the program The Youth with *Europa *III with the end to include to *Turquía among the countries *beneficiarios Speaker: Mr. *Gargani.
And it is it because, although *Turquía is a country that has shown #any difficulty in this terrain - *le confess, gentleman President, that in the commission has listened  the echo of this problematic, of this difficulty to the hour to accept this idea in the #european field, in the *Europa so opened to the culture, as they have reiterated along #all the afternoon the distinct orators in his speeches on the four measures that, in some mood, are interrelated - believe that this decision will carry to describe to *Europa in his whole like a group of States that watches to the new countries of open way and with big dignity and offers great possibilities of development from the point of sight of the freedom and of the culture.
In fact, in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission in the that it examined  #all this sector of the auxiliary doctors and in period of training put of relief seven looks that require the adoption of measures immediate: the excessive labour day in #some countries; the question of the policemen; fixation of turns little realistic; prolonged periods of permanent service; the distribution of the services among the auxiliary doctors and the upper doctors; the no official pressures that suffer the doctors in period of training; the vulnerability of the periods of rest in front of the pressure of the necessary service.
We have to react it before possible, especially by what know the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone: the *hidroclorofluorocarburos *HCFC, used mainly in the facilities of refrigerated and of air conditioned, as dissolvent and for the production of plastics *esponjados of isolation; the bromide of methyl, allocated mainly to the fumigation of the earths of crop to combat the harmful animals and the illnesses of the plants, classified by the WHO in the category of substances highly poisonous ; the chlorofluorocarbons *CFC, used in the systems of refrigeration and used before in the manufacture of plastics *esponjados, of dissolvent and like gases *propelentes for aerosols; the *halones use  to combat fires, in particular in areas #where the extinction of fires is subjected to hard controls of quality specifically in the planes, and in products of replacement no dangerous.
The States members agree in that it is necessary to avert the contradictions among the project of Convention and among the guidelines of performance elaborated by the Union, as they are, for example, the measures of action common adopted on 3 December 1998 regarding the bleaching of money, the recognition of the instruments and benefits of the offences, the methods of persecution, the freezing of bottoms and the sentences of embargo and expropriation, and also the measures adopted on 21 December 1998 on the *involucración of the authorities in the criminal activities.
More intense has to be #ours worry in front of the attempts to avert and to substitute the convention of Gin, that is the basic source of International Right by the that govern  the refugees, with the approval of a diet of protection provisional, and also in front of the considerations on the modification of the Agreement of *Dublín on the asylum, on the hardening of the relative legislation to the procedure of processing of the requests of asylum, and on the most effective application of the procedures to move away to the persons #whose requests of residence are refused
#This is the reason by the *cual the Commission of Freedoms Public proposed that, from now, in the field of the politics of asylum and of immigration there are two budgetary instruments: the first, a #european bottom for the refugees allocated to fund of a structural way the necessary measures for the received, the integration and the voluntary repatriation of the refugees in case of a normal flow; and the second, #one *segunda budgetary line to allow the adoption of measures of emergency in the case of influx massive of refugees.
Gentleman President, the commitment of the European Union, confirmed in the Report *Schwaiger, in favour of the creation of a permanent forum of work among the International Organisation of the Work and the World-wide Organisation of the Trade to treat of the subjects related with the trade, the globalisation and the work is the only road to accompany the liberalisation of the trade and the exchanges in general to the respect to the fundamental rights of the work, without dropping in the selfish protectionism and *hipócrita or in the disloyal competition and *autodestructiva.
It is necessary that the Parliament say, before that the Council decide the creation of an organ commissioned to draft the project of Letter, that #can not accept a number of representatives of the inferior European Parliament to the of the representatives of the bosses of Government of the States members and that ask an attentive query before deciding #if the essential contribution of the national parliaments has to guarantee   through the participation of a true number of his representatives in the planned organ or through other more effective channels.

The consciousness that of the problematic #canarian had those who in *España negotiate the adhesion of our country to the European Communities and the successive Treaties that get until the of *Amsterdam, and the constant worry by that that specific situation was always taken in account remained reflected in the special Protocol *nº 2 of the Record of Adhesion of *España and *Portugal, already in 1985, in the Regulation *CEE *nº 191191 of the Council, that approved said Protocol and in the own section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty *CE, that describes the peripheral regions of the Union with special quotation to Canarians and prescribes the precise flexibility for the application of the general norms to cases so determined and vulnerable like the that here *nos occupies.

The Commission of Subjects Economic defends that said period do not exceed of two months, and so that #this was like this is necessary that the #ECB, the Commission and the national administrations take a series of measures, of the that #some already have quoted  here: cater to consumers, dealers, and banks with the necessary quantity of coins and notes before 1 January of the 2002, generalise for 1 January of the 2001 the double indication of prices, take advantage of this process for *modernizar our systems of payment and adopt the precise disposals to ensure a suitable legal protection that prevent the fraud.

The proposal to celebrate a *mini-session in *Bruselas a Wednesday - of course *cuando the deputies already are in *Bruselas to assist to the meetings of the Groups and of the commissions - #would have allowed to the President of the Commission assist to the Parliament and inform on the results of the weekly meeting of the Commission, and show like this to the citizens that the Commission is responsible in front of the Parliament and elevate our profile to *través of the announcement in the breast of this institution of the important initiatives of the Commission.

The European Council of *Tampere had like goal schedule and give course to the materialisation of the Space of Freedom, Security and Justice decided in the Treaty of *Amsterdam with seen to the achievement of a greater coordination or even the existence of politics common, as in the case of the immigration, of the asylum and of the politics of visas, it that, to our trial, and taking into account the importance of the sector of the public freedoms, justice and security, demands that it guarantee  the process of decision by unanimity in the Council, with respect of the sovereignty of the States members.
It #would be important - and #this was the amendment that wanted to present - that, among the tasks of this Observatory, precisely from the optics of a #european integration that it has to be increasingly a political integration, an integration of the societies and of the way to take politics, an integration of the to scale #european information, existed, for example, the follow-up and control of the presences in the distinct televisions of #all *Europa and of the political activity member of parliament of the political strengths so much to scale national like European, that in this way #can have a point of reference in the Observatory.
#If, in place to abstain  in the Council, there was, to the equal that *Alemania, voted in favour of the maintenance of the embargo in front of the absence of elements indispensable of *rastreabilidad, the embargo #would be in vigour, the consumers #would be in security, the proofs #would be preparing  bear *ilustrarnos, #would have averted  the *desencadenamiento of *chauvinismo of the another side of the Stain for honour of the big #british village and our conservative friends #would not have had to complain of the principle of sovereignty to the that are legitimately *apegados.
I believe that it is insufficient, wanted colleagues, because we still follow treating of the problem as #if it treated  of a circumstantial problem, *cuando in reality *Europa is suffering a structural problem of some historical dimensions, fruit of a change in the mood of production, fruit of an increase of the productivity in the work that carries to that increases of the product and of the wealth do not accompany  with increases of the persons employed and that this increase of the wealth distribute it  the companies and the workers that have work and leave out of the feast to those who are worse situated: to the women, to the youngsters without qualification, to the unemployed of long length.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00431999 of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, concerning the common position adopted by the relative Council to the proposal of Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive *8877CEE 573411999 - *C5 - 00281999 - *19970350COD of the Council, relative to the approximation of the States members on the measures that have to adopt against the broadcast of gases and particles *contaminantes pertinent of engines *diesel allocated to the propulsion of vehicles Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer Speaker: Mr. *Lange.
#One *Europa directed by a directory #would be the negation of a stimulating process of #european integration that have lived -with imperfections, true is, but with the participation of #all the countries-, by it that the cooperation reinforced, in our opinion, has to be an exception and no a rule of the work inside the European Union, because many times there #be political will to cooperate, but there are not conditions, from the point of sight economic or from another point of sight, to take reality this will of cooperation reinforced.
The result of the unofficial meeting of the Ministers of Subjects External, celebrated in *Saariselkä, and that it was published in the conclusions of the Council of Subjects General of 13 September, #as well as the participation of the Minister of Subjects External, Mr. *Cemin, in the breakfast of the Council of Subjects General are signals that, in opinion of the #finnish Presidency, mean a new constructive beginning in the relations among the European Union and *Turquía.
Therefore, with the hand in the chest, *cuando read the newspapers, ascertain that even in the breast of the European Union our goals, *ora the goals of politics of environment, *ora the goals of politics social, *ora the essential labour norms, were presented of protectionist way; #if among *nosotros, in the European Union, have not been able to share our goals, so much less in the breast of the group of states of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
Gentleman President, although it is positive that the European Union want to expand to other countries to consolidate in *ellos the development of the democracy and to strengthen his economic capacity of face to confront the world-wide market -in the *cual, reiterate it by *enésima time, have to defend the national productive peculiarities struggling against the homologation and the *nivelación, indisputable causes of the loss of the specific cultures and of the quality of the products- is equally necessary that the Parliament reiterate firmly that the entry of a new country has to be subordinated to the effective application in #the same of the criteria that already fixed  in *Amsterdam.
Our proposal of resolution will contain especially the dynamic elements that have been treated already by the President of the Council and also by the Commissioner *Lamy and that contain our ideas for a better inclusion of the financial provision, for a politics of investments and of competition in the frame of the *OMC, for a back reduction of the tariffs on the industrial products and for a better inclusion, even *Mainstreaming, of the protection of the environment and of the consumer in the regulatory drama of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
*Yo Expect, therefore, that, after this first communication of the Commission, the present Commission in front of the Parliament a strategic program, with a necessary legislative package, with more time by part of the Commission and by part of the Parliament, but expect also that, along this term of office, the inner market convert  in a reality and that, when converting  in a reality, take  in benefit of the citizens, take  in benefit of the workers and that allow to follow consolidating this social model European that *yo #would say that, in this moment, constitutes the envy of the countries that do not belong to the European Union.
Gentleman *Lamy, *yo *le urge, therefore, to that *usted and the Commission take also #his these points that finish to enumerate, to the equal that #others wider, and concretise and guarantee the inclusion of these fundamental looks already in the inaugural round of negotiations, so that in the next years #can follow working in the frame of the Round of the #Millenium so that the World-wide Organisation of Trade was it that wish that it was, an organisation of the just and respectful trade with the environment that *nos allow to develop the commercial exchanges, but allowing at the same time the existence of our persons and of our environment.
Personally I have been able to check that to an applicant of asylum #nigerian  *le was conceding asylum on the base of a false passport of #Liberia, that a #albanian family took  happen by natural of *Kosovo, that another Nigerian had borrowed his #british passport to his cousin and taking happen by *él had been able to go in in the Realm Joined, #where committed an offence, and that a #algerian was living with the identity of a #french citizen and had bought his document of identity in the #black market of #París.
Therefore, in name of the Spaniards that in this moment are enormously concerned by the subject, expect that the Commission transmit to the Council our worry, our disagreement with the last resolutions of the Council of Ministers of Industry -that seems #willing, in a sweet *laissez *faire, to abandon it little that *nos remains of naval sector European- and the hope that or well take  measured to avert this disloyal competition that is producing  or, of not to take like this, proceed  to a rearm of the community helps to compensate the inequalities, incompetences and bad forms that are producing  today in #all the centres of the naval construction.
*Permítame Take advantage of this opportunity to signal that the speaker of the Commission of Control Budgetary, the Mrs. *Theato, and *yo have taken part together in front of a committee for the taking of contact of #all the presidents of the Courts of Accounts national of the States members and of the Court of Accounts to communicate to these key persons that the fight against the fraud to the community bottoms is also a national task.
In the level of the European Council, it that decided  was that the Bosses of State or of Government #would occupy  again of the matters related with the justice and the subjects of interior in the European Council of June of the year 2000, the Council of Saint #Maria gives *Feira, to appreciate more in detail the called external dimension of the justice and the subjects of interior, is to say, the implications in the sphere of the external politics of the European Union of the new priorities approved by *Tampere for the sector of freedom, security and justice.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00331999 of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position 86971999 - *C5-00311999 - 19980071 *COD approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive *70221CEE of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the deposits of fuel liquid and the devices of protection rear of the vehicles to engine and of his trailers
Like only instrument of finance and programming for the cooperation, CULTURE 2000 bills a group of goals directed to attend, more and better, these needs, with it that it #can represent a decisive step with seen to a cultural politics #worthy European of this name, is to say, an instrument that allow the contact reiterated, interactive and child-bearing among the cultures of the diverse countries members so that the variety of the sectors considered and the *multidisciplinaridad of the realisations are increasingly an element *vivificante of the own *humus of the #european identity without damage of the pluralism and of the essential diversity of these cultures.
*GOODYEAR, *RENAULT, now *MICHELIN -adapting to the models of development promoted with the creation of the only inner market, and stressed with the Treaties of *Maastricht and *Amsterdam and with the Economic and Monetary Union-, have cost  of the conditions of immunity that have gone  creating, with the progressive disappearance of #all notion of responsibility social and of protection of the workers, and that have deprived of his employment to an every time greater number of persons, *empujándolas to the space of the unemployment and of the social marginalisation.
Also the President of the Government of Canarians has announced his wish to visit *Marruecos to keep a dialogue and a road of communication direct with the #moroccan Government, in the line of fine *vecindad that it has to characterise the relations among two neighbouring villages and civilised, since, many times, the viscosity of the reality -as well it said the #another day the Mr. *Obiols in the debate in *Bruselas, in relation with the common destination among *Europa and *Marruecos- do not allows many times act of the most convenient way.

I #can manifest, for having chaired yesterday the meeting of #all the groups of this Parliament during the put ready of a project of resolution common that, to the contrary that #some #others, will not be a text of commitment, and in any form of a commitment among divergent positions, but a synthesis enriched of the proposals of each #one of the political families gathered, in a common will to contribute the contribution of this Parliament to a political solution to the drama that is *ensangrentando *Chechenia today.
And especially, it #would say, in relation with #one of the fundamental questions, that is the *litigio *grecoturco on the *Egeo, do not exists, is not a necessary requirement the recognition express by *Turquía, no of the points of sight of another country, but yes of the commitment that it will respect the international right, the commitment that it will not resort to the violence and will not loom with resorting to the violence, and that in the case that they persist the differences will attend to the International Court of The there #be Is #this a necessary condition for his recognition like country candidate to the adhesion?

Finally, I want to underline only two points that, on the base of our #italian experience, result especially important and significant: first, the importance to support the scientific investigation of base to know better the phenomenon and, to be possible, know with *antelación #which will be the calls drug of the future, in particular know the power *devastador of the synthetic drugs; second, the importance to involve in our actions to the main actors, #that that are in first line, in the trenches #all the days and that loan help to the *toxicómanos, or was, the experience of the centres of detoxication.
Regarding the practical application, it important now is that the Commission of the EU and the States members manifest also in the concrete cases the will of not to limit to ascertain the rapes of the human rights and, therefore, also of an essential component of the agreement, but to apply also the planned juridical sanctions in each case, that by general rule begin with a query and #can get until the partial suspension of the agreement or even of his whole.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, after the report published the year happened on *Turquía by our colleagues the *Srs *Macmillan-#Scott and *Swoboda, #as well as the resolution of our Parliament of the past 6 October, that put of relief the importance of the deepening of the #european strategy bear with this country, our Assembly #would have to can adopt tomorrow two proposals of regulation of the Parliament and of the relative Council to the execution of actions directed to the economic and social development of *Turquía, the first, and to the deepening of the Union *Aduanera among the European Community and *Turquía.
In the measure in that the new necessary changes of the institutions, or even institutions entirely new, like the new military body so important that has decided , *nos situate in front of difficult dilemmas on how assign the power among the national and community authorities, do not forget the message of the *UEM: that the community institutions succeed *cuando applies  correctly the principle of subsidiariness and *cuando the strength of his powerful partners sees  balanced by the consolidation of the rights of the feeblest partners.
The intervention of the European Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission will contribute no only to protect with greater solidity a group of interests that specified  opportunely, but also to reaffirm an authentic leadership of the European Union so that Chinese #can not leave to see in *ella a preferential speaker in a *geoestrategia linked to the peace, the construction of the democracy, the *salvaguardia of the human rights, the development, the dialogue and the modernity in the plane of the world-wide scene.
*Me Allow to suggest that to avert surprises in the future, the Council and the Parliament watch very of wall the mission of maintenance of the peace of the Nations Joined, the plan of help humanitarian of *Europa, the integrity of any current program or future allocated to put term to the suffering of the population of *Timor to guarantee his full independence and his free sovereignty of #all threat, interference or pressure *proveniente of the #indonesian soldiers and of his #american advisers.
It do not fits doubt that the resumption of the process of peace after the end of the Government of the Mr. *Netanyahu, the election of #Barak and the new agreement signed in *Sharm the *Sheikh are a step advance with regard to the *tinieblas of the past, after the murder of the prime minister *Rabin; without embargo, the path is still difficult before achieving a stable and durable peace that the Palestinians #can live, #such as it establishes  in the resolutions of the Organisation of the Nations Joined, in a Palestinian State that expect that it was democratic and #can *coexistir peacefully with the State of #Israel.

Likewise *me cheers that the Mr. *Vitorino have announced the Monday in the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects that the Commission goes to present early a study on the concrete realisation of this project as I create really that #if #ours police forms  jointly in the #european spirit and #if, #such as it foresees  in the resolution, includes  also from the principle to the police of the countries candidates -proposed that comes from also of this Assembly-, then will give an important concrete step to #one *Europa of the right and of the inner security.
With our amendments wanted to reach a simplification of the structures, an improvement of the communication with the objective group, a transparent configuration of the executive procedures, a greater participation of disadvantaged groups and a greater diffusion of the informations on the program to reach a better access and, finally, #one *flexibilización of the limits of age of the participants to find to the dessert an approach of solution horizontal in the *comitología.
#If I have accepted, finally, *adherirme to the resolution that will subject  to vote of our colleagues, is because I have been able to *percatarme of the true emotional state of a part of the world-wide public opinion; these worries, joined to the words pronounced previously on the reaction of the #japanese Government and of other international organisms, that ask to the populations that take cautions, that procure  reservations of foods, in forecast of this end of the world announced, *me confirm in the idea that the cautions *preconizadas by our Parliament are, because of his prudence, able to appease the fears, and, therefore, #can be useful.
#The same works in the definition of a system of courts of arbitration in the line of the traditional practice, in that the courts are constituted by citizens chosen in the different levels of the local administration, and that will judge, in principle, three categories of accused: the common murderers, on the one hand, the accused to strike and injure without *ocasionar the death, by #another, and, finally, the *saqueadores, of #such mood that the instigators and the ideologists of the genocide and of the slaughterings are sure enough judged by ordinary courts, that treats , in some mood, to organise to face up to this task.
Of this way the youngsters, especially the less accommodated and more disadvantaged will be able to see in the program *SOCRATES a possibility of integration, cultural enrichment and professional training, but first of all a possibility to have a personal experience, a vital experience to purchase the flexibility and the necessary mental opening to confront it better possible the occupational challenges of the world of the work.

A concrete action made in this sense was the requirement presented by the #finnish Presidency in the session of the 54 General Assembly of the UN that the international community aspire with *tesón to find the solutions and the timely answers to confront the new and unpredictable challenges in the frame of the international humanitarian Right; likewise, the EU has the intention to take out to *relucir this question in #all the international contacts.
Among #others, on the type of interest legal that will apply  *cuando produce  the delay of a payment, the extension of the period of activation of the interests, in case that it have not stipulated  a period of payment in an agreement; of retention of the title, while there #be delay of the payment; the paper of the public sector and the treatment of the public agreements; and the claims of compensation caused by delays of payments.
On the base of the current data consider #this as sufficient, but of course are had to debate also on this subject *cuando complete  the information, because, as #all know, the approval of the budget demands that the two responsible organs of the budgetary power reach an agreement on the subject, as to the principle declared, a fine cooperation and the confidence, #as well as the will to look for common solutions is the half, with #whose help will be able to, with #all security, conclude *felizmente the approval of the budget for the year 2000.
Had account that the Army of Release of *Kosovo *ELK continues freely his illegal activity, organising a traffic of arms and of drugs, as it collects the international press, and consummating with impunity the execution of numerous innocent #serbian citizens, #can indicate the Council how initiatives thinks to adopt so that it summon  immediately the Council of Security of the Nations Joined so as to clear the circumstances of the slaughtering of *Gnjilane, examine as a whole the situation of the human rights, evaluate the paper of the *KFOR in *Kosovo and take immediate and concrete decisions in relation with the *ELK, #as well as measures of protection of the #serbian population, #gipsy and other communities that remain in *Kosovo?
The Commission, as it will know the Assembly, regrets deeply the continuous rapes of the human rights by part of the military authorities in *Birmania: in particular, the treatment *opresivo that suffer the ethnic minorities, the persecution of *Aung Saint *Suu *Kyi and other members of the *LND, the denial of rights basic to the unions and the practice of works forced, the prohibition of the free operation of the political parties, the innumerable arbitrary arrests and the continuous state of violence.
The goals to board a political dialogue are to explain the common position of the European Union on the situation of the human rights and the nonexistence of a state of right and of democracy in *Birmania, and to contribute to the creation of some favourable conditions so that it initiate  a political dialogue among the military joint in the power, the *SPDC, and the democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.

The Council has time for the reflection and the decision on the means: time for the reflection because *nos will gather on 25 November - by Saint #Catalina any tree ruins  and expect that the budgetary tree throw roots -, and the decision on the means *le corresponds to *usted, lady Speaker - and his colleagues, since I know that it #can not it all and regret it -, choose among two roads: the review of the financial perspectives of the category 4 that *nos will allow to vote this budget facing up to the new priorities of compliance with the commitments that have assumed  during the negotiation of this agreement.

This conception #would conduct directly, according to the ancient professional deformation of the Commission, to concede the primacy to the free circulation of the commodities on the health of the consumers, as we finish to see in the subject of the embargo of the meat of bovine #british, in the that it #would be necessary, lady Speaker, expect to that have  of the proofs, it that *nos conducts, by it other, to the extraordinary following conclusion: the that inside the European Union did not applies  the principle of caution, whereas it tries  take that it prevail in the relations with third countries, in particular with the States Joined.
The Commission also #can support the relative amendments to the enlargement of the directive to include other alternative fuels, in east marry ethanol; the amendment that refers  to the fiscal incentives applied to the *reequipamiento of old vehicles; the amendment that includes the heavy vehicles in the community general strategy referred to the dioxide of carbon and the relative amendment to the commercial quality of the liquid petrol.
It has had knowledge the Commission of the opening of an investigation, or of appeal of information or of recommendations to reach agreements, by part of the Department of State of the #EE.UU., directed to the Group Sun-*Meliá, with previous character to the application to this group and to other companies of the EU Club *Med, *LTU, in frank rape of the Agreements reached among the European Commission and the Administration #Clinton, in the frame of the Transatlantic Summit, that excluded of the field of application of the Law *Helms-*Burton to the #european companies?
#If we split of the premise that a world-wide trade freer and juster has been the foundation that has allowed to improve the level of welfare of #a lot of States and his populations, especially in the case of the countries in development, then also have to recognise that the European Union, in his quality of greater commercial power of the world, has an elementary interest in continuing promoting this favourable evolution and in that an increasing number of villages and of States take part in #the same.
To measure that increases the number of competitors international in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, precisely in the rich nations and especially in the States Joined, that are those who more have benefited  of the liberalisation of the markets, is growing -paradoxically, wanted to add *yo- the scepticism and the worry in front of the possibility that the globalisation also carry rigged an impoverishment, the destruction of the environment and the loss of sovereignty national.
The Commission of Control Budgetary proposes  answer in his writing of opinion to the *interrogante on the suitability to tackle the development of the controls and an effective protection of the community finances by means of the creation of a charge of public prosecutor #european according to the diagram proposed in the *Corpus *Juris , but in the sense of the subsidiariness, #such as *nos posed and cleared the past week in the session of *Bruselas the gentleman Commissioner *Barnier.
They have achieved  pose with considerable clarity and of consistent way the political requirements associated to the cooperation with *Turquía, in particular the need that they respect  and develop  the human rights, among *ellos the rights of the village *kurdo, the requirement of the abolition of the pity of death, the strengthening of the civil society, a greater participation of the no governmental organisations and the reduction of the social disadvantages and of the regional underdevelopment.
In this sense, tomorrow will propose -to the contrary of it that, apparently, think #others- the postponement of the vote of the two reports for a period of sessions back and ask to the Speaker of the European Parliament that, in name of the institution that chairs, formulate a request expresses to the European Council of *Helsinki so that, #if it keeps  the decision of the #turkish authorities, the Council adopt a very firm position in relation with the candidature of *Turquía to the European Union.
Without leaving to respect the confidentiality of the conversations, *yo #can *decirles, in any case, that my personal impression is that the #turkish Government did not wishes to take in any case a decision on the execution of the sentence while it last the procedure of *Estrasburgo, but that his strategy is directed rather to take advantage of the like this won time to abolish the pity of death in *Turquía.
But I believe that no  *le #can dribble to the Presidency in exercise of the Council the merit that they have produced  substantial advances in the field of the external politics and of common security reorganising the works of the Council, giving a clear impulse to the no military management of the crises, adopting the common strategy on the case of *Ucrania and adopting also a statement in the case of *Chechenia, although to *nosotros *nos had enjoyed that it went a bit more conclusive and believe that the time *nos will give the reason.
Also it suits to remember that, in the report of the Court of Accounts that finishes to #make  and that have debated this week, have not found in #all the agricultural sector any indication of swindle massive or fraud on a large scale, but have observed that seems to have *muchísimos problems to the hour to reckon the number of livestock, the quantity of hectares by help to surface, etc. Exist small errors in a very wide field and *eso constitutes a grave problem that owe *encarar.
In the category *I agricultural costs, support to the markets are already to the limit of the *margen; in the category *IV external actions - will go back on *ello - the category literally explodes, in the category *V do not know it that will cost the administrative reform of the Commission, but see with #a lot of worry how outlines  the problem of the retirements without that have foreseen  the costs adapted; and in the category *VII allocated to the *preadhesión, the movement in favour of a faster enlargement and wider, #if it #can say  like this, do not enjoys of the credits adapted.
The Scientific Committee has shown clearly his *convencimiento that the meat of bovine #british is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of any part of the European Union and in these circumstances am safe that the Commissioner will suit *conmigo in that a delay of only some days is better that the of two or three years in the courts, it that finishes frustrating to #everyone, do not satisfies to nobody and, in particular, do not satisfies to the #british graziers that have observed the law, have taken it that  *les has asked and are now in conditions to sell an excellent product in #all the European Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00561999, in name of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, concerning the common position, approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to a program of action community Program *DAPHNE 2000-2003 on preventive measures allocated to combat the violence exerted on the boys, the teenagers and the women 915011999-*C5-01811999 - *19980192COD Speaker: Mrs. *Avilés *Perea.
I believe that it is just to affirm that it exists general consensus in the European Union - among the Council, the Parliament and the Commission - on the two following proposals: in the first place, in spite of the comprehensible indignation by the appalling acts of terrorism in *Moscú, in the *Cáucaso North and in other parts - that like citizen of a country that has suffered *demasiadas experiences of terrorism condemn totally -, the #russian action during the last weeks has supposed a reiterated deployment of a disproportionate military strength, the reiterated contempt of the need to look for a political solution and the reiterated contempt of the tragic consequences for the persons.
Without embargo, fifty years after the Universal Statement of the Human Rights, know that they do not exist rights conquered #all at the same time and for ever: I think in the *Tíbet, *Birmania, *Timor and in the #asian countries in that it explodes  the childish and feminine work; I think in *Kosovo, in *Chechenia or in *África, a continent *demasiadas far times and forgotten; I think in the 790 millions of persons that happen *hambre in the world or in the 300 millions of boys that are forced to work; I think, besides, in the 1.625 executions fulfilled the year happened in the 72 countries that in his legislations keep the pity of death; finally I think in the destination of the leader *kurdo *Ocalan, #whose life has to be saved by means of the effort of #all *nosotros.
And all *ello because, although this Parliament has expressed an indeclinable commitment in favour of a moratorium of the pity of death, as we took in the debate of the last session *plenaria -believe that the Speaker has directed  already to the #turkish authorities by this reason- think that the European Union has to fulfil his commitments and, to #the same time, that #can not leave to recognise that in the last fifteen years in *Turquía has not executed  any pity of death.
It is not only the case *Ocalan that *me takes to say that the candidature of *Turquía is not mature still. Among other things, *Ocalan went practically delivered by the Government of the Mr. *D *Alema -#one dishonours for #Italia- but, on the other hand, precisely of the penal Code Italian *Turquía has copied this article 155 of his penal Code that has allowed the conviction of *Ocalan - the article 155 of the penal Code Turkish, copied of the article 241 of the penal Code Italian- and, therefore, also the position of the #italian Government in this case no *me has *extrañado at all.
Report *A5-00741999 of the Mr. *Pronk, in name of the Delegation of the Parliament for the Commission of conciliation on the text attach, approved by the Commission of Conciliation, on the proposal of directive of the relative Council to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of the health and of the security of the workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres. Commission of Social Subjects and Employment, *Décima *quinta managerial individual relative to the article 161 of the Directive *89391CEE *C5-02211991 - *19950235COD
will signal that, from fifteen years ago, in *Turquía exists a moratorium in fact on the pity of death; that the goal of the report that, precisely, subject to vote is to incite to the #turkish Government to that this moratorium in fact convert  in moratorium of right; and that, in any case, *me ask #which #would be the reaction of our colleagues #if, in his countries of origin, existed, as *ellos wish, an intrusion of the political power in the judicial power. Since at present the cause of the Mr. *Ocalan is subjected to the Court of Security of *Estrasburgo.
The technical obstacles that #would pose the greater difficulties to reduce the transitory period are, specifically: the terms of manufacture of the notes and of the coins in euros; the considerable importance of the computer adaptations that they have to make, and also the fact that the transition to the euro of the public administrations has been scheduled for the year 2002, to end to take in consideration the complexity of the changes that have to introduce in this sector.
Of compliance with the article 245 of the constitutive Treaty of the *CE, with the article 45 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community of the Coal and the Steel and with the article 160 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community of the Atomic Energy, the Council #can change the disposals on the maintenance of the secret only to request of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-01011999 of the Mr. *Papayannakis, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council that modifies the Regulation *CE *nº 82097 of the Council by the that it establishes  a system of identification and register of the animals of the bovine and relative species to the labeling of the meat of *vacuno and the products to base of meat of *vacuno *COM1999 487 - *C5-02411999 - *19990205COD.
By evident reasons, that have relation with the geography but also with the history, seemed necessary to the Europeans engage, during the years 70, an action of cooperation of *envergadura with the countries of *África, of the *Caribe and of the Peaceful, under a quite original form known with the name of Agreement of *Lomé, and that allowed that our partners of the south benefited  of stable prices for the products of the that extract his main resources, *ello to the coat of a free change in #all directions of the that it only that sees  is how ruins today the most fragile economies.
We aspire to that of #the same way in that today it takes it the Parliament, the Council direct from *Tampere an audible message to the #european citizens, the message that the European Union really interests  and works by his more vital interests: the *reforzamiento of the inner security, the free circulation, the free access to the justice, the fight against the delinquency organised international, the control of the borders, the respect of the rights and fundamental freedoms.
The proposal of the Commission to create a #european agency for the reconstruction is based mainly in the recommendations of the Parliament for the reconstruction of *Bosnia - recommendations that aptly take upsetting in the need to decentralise the management of the help to *través of the increase of the participation of personnel local and the contribution of mechanisms that adapt  better to the urgency of the requirements of the reconstruction.
Lady Speaker, in virtue of the article 111 of the Regulation of the European Parliament, propose an amendment to the agenda of this partial period of sessions to include a statement of the Commission on the refusal of the #french Government to raise the embargo of meat and his decision to prevent that the meat of *vacuno of the Realm Joined cross his territory, that is a route forced to get to *España and #Italia.
Said #this and considering that *nos find in a historical moment of the #european construction with the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice, in front of a debate on a Letter of rights fundamental, and considering likewise the powers awarded to the Council by the Treaties to carry out actions that guarantee these rights of the #european citizens, *me #would enjoy to know the attitude of the Council with regard to the content of said Letter of fundamental rights in matter of protection of sexual freedom and of sexual option more that of sexual orientation.
Without embargo it is necessary to develop painstakingly this system of documentation, extending it also to the torture and to the means employed for the other inhuman and degrading deals, so that the information was to disposal of the national parliaments #as well as of this Assembly before it produce  a greater diffusion and like this the control on the export of arms was effective, having of the suitable political instruments and juridical to take part the transgression of the norms on the systems of control.
In these lines guidelines and in the finance of #many of these politics are included #many of the proposals that have listened  in this hemicycle, #such like special fiscal reductions for the workers and for the small and medium enterprises, like a support to the education or to the training of the workers with seen to the dismissals or to the restructurings, #as well as social packages to reinforce the social network in case of great restructurings, the continuous training and the provision of workers with new aptitudes so that they #can answer to these restructurings.
The amendment 7, that *versa on the actions integrated in agreements of transnational cultural cooperation, composes  of two parts: in the first place, the relative to the paper of the committee and more in particular the obligation by part of the managers of the projects funded to present a balance of the actions undertaken directly to the committee, as this control *incumbe to the Commission, that has to also commission of the management of the program; second, the relative part to the addition of the precision specialists of the heritage.
#If the Central Bank European considers dangerous a rhythm of growth upper to the 2,5% and, according to the assessments of the Commission, has to have  a rhythm of growth upper to the 3% to reduce the employment to the 7% in 6 or 7 years, then the only path that *les remains, and of course follow *ustedes with coherence, is *presionar to the labour market to cancel the labour relations, impose the work to half day and, more generally, *flexibilizar the employment, reduce really the wages and finish with the social security.
I want to appreciate to the speaker and to the and the colleagues of the Commission of Industry the inclusion in the final report of #many of the looks approved in the Commission of Environment, which #can not  give by discounted neither neither occurs always, and that our aspirations have found fit in the amendments of the speaker and in the amendments of commitment, so that big part of the questions that the Commission of Environment considers important with seen to *Seattle have remained integrated in the report of the Mr. *Schwaiger.
It is an exceptional democratic event that thousands of men and women have debated and have manifested  by a distinct economy, directly linked to the daily life and the democracy, because the fact that 134 governments form part of the World-wide Organisation of Trade do not guarantees of by himself\/hisself neither transparency neither democracy in the processes of taking of decisions because, further of the formal statutes, it that *subsiste really is the contractual power of the strongest Governments and of the multinationals that exert it.
Has to include  also in the Treaties this Letter of rights fundamental that goes to elaborate  in the next months; contemplate the taking of decisions by majority -like general norm- and, logically, of simultaneous way, the procedure of *codecisión in these moments; expand also the powers of the European Parliament, for example the capacity to ratify #all the international treaties, was *cual was his type or type; and, of course, contemplate that the next reforms take  in accordance with a much more open method, transparent, democratic and participatory that the current.
Gentleman President, with occasion of the presentation of this bulky report on the human rights, will mention the constant rapes of said rights committed with the foundation of a legislation *estalinista against the intellectuals of #all the specialities that have  brave to issue critical opinions or simply independent concerning the history of the last world-wide war, #whose drama *concentracionario *obnubila increasingly to the media, to the education, to the press, to the service of interests very distinct of the exclusive defence of the memory of the victims.
Apart from his strictly economic meaning, that do not leaves to be great, these institutions have offered to our villages the real proof that the creation of new community institutions attendants of the exercise of a politics integrated in the place of the governments or of the national institutions of the States members do not constitutes a betrayal, but a conjoint exercise more effective of our national sovereignty.
We consider important that there are two representatives of the European Parliament in the preparatory group, but already consider less #worthy for the European Parliament that his Speaker, instead of relating  exclusively with the bosses of State and the prime ministers, see  immersed in a dynamics in the that  the hear before the meetings of the members of the Council of Subjects General and #that is not a #worthy deal for this European Parliament.
We have seen that the Court of Justice has ratified the faculty of the States members to take decisions in this matter and besides, regarding the point that *usted has underlined relative to the distribution inside the territory of a State, have to add that the norms in matter of competition and the principle of no discrimination do not force to the States members to take in account looks of regional character to the hour to award the licences for the casinos neither other permissions to organise games of chance.
It has needed , as, more of a year and varied meetings of the Committee of Conciliation to reach an agreement on this program, #tending to promote the quality of the education to *través of the promotion of the cooperation, of the intensification of the mobility and of the development of the #european dimension in #all the educational sectors, with the end to complete the actions of the States members in this field.
In the case of *Kuwait, it that has *sucedido to finals of November, *cuando with 32 votes against and 30 in favour the Parliament has refused the proposal that the women #can vote and be voted, do not constitutes only a rape of the human rights and a repulsive political action, but also is an infringement of the own #kuwaiti Constitution, that in the article 29 has that #all the citizens are equal in front of the law, independently of the sex, the religion, the race or the ethnic origin.
It is an opportunity to explore his promise to collaborate with the Parliament and embrace *decididamente our interest for examining the application of the process of reforms and also his constructive commitment with our worries like deputies by a #european economy that was based in the knowledge, the aptitudes and the creativity and a #european society based in the inclusion, the diversity and the cultural wealth.
So much today, in the speech of the Speaker of the Council, as two weeks ago, in the audition of the Commissioner *Vitorino, have appreciated -*nosotros, the deputies, *habituados to the *langue of *bois of the Council and of the Commission- elements of philosophical rigour on the fundamental budgets of this true inner market of the freedom and the justice, is to say, the market of the values -and no already the of the commodities and the services- that *nos inspire an optimism reserved on *Tampere and his consequences. ?Why?
Subject: Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC The past June, the Bosses of State of the European Union, gathered in the Summit of Colony, agreed that the next commercial negotiations of the Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC had to include the labour norms, alleging that: Some negotiations that cover a wide fan of subjects, included the norms of work, environment, development and transparency, constitute the most appropriate base to reach substantial results and balanced in benefit of #all the members of the *OMC.
Subject: Installation of a nuclear head office in a highly exposed zone to seismic movements as it is the region of *Akköy in *Turquía The *tremendo seism, so much in extension as in intensity, that recently has shaken *Turquía, no only has caused considerable damages, but that also *replantea of dramatic form the project of construction of a gigantic nuclear head office of production of electrical energy in the region of *Akköy, to the southwest of *Turquía, project in the that persists the #turkish Government, in spite of treating  of a zone that comports a high seismic risk as they confirm #all the studies carried out by specialists.
. *FR The deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of the Nations have voted against of the group of the amendments approved in the Commission of Environment, #tending to transform the recommendation of the Commission in directive, and *ello by three essential reasons: relative reason to the bureaucracy, relative reason to the juridical foundation and relative reason to the structure of the bodies of control in the States members of the European Union.
*Cuando The philosophy that conditions the relative proposals centres  in the concept of citizen according to the law and of the need of attribution of responsibilities to those that loom the freedom and the security of the persons and of the society, only #can ascertain the comeback of those theories that in countries like the #ours, went in the happened the base of the laws and the limitations *antidemocráticas, the base to penalise the political and #sindical action.
By a part, the agricultural employers, from takes time and strongly stuck to the train of the rigid conditions of production, guarantee and back fully, as they show it the history and the actuality, the maturity of the consumer; by #another, the possible path to solve the problem is tied to the *proprio consumer that has comprised perfectly the #european politics in matter of marks and of typical products giving validity to the local products Europeans, perfectly able to avert the *aplastamiento in the international competition that, by the contrary, prevails the foods *masificados.
Without embargo, wanted to urge to the Commissioner to that it take *algo more: #if his colleagues and *él are decided to recover the confidence of the consumers and of the alimentary industry in the relative structures to the *inocuidad of the foods of the EU, has to create a #european agency attendant of the similar foods to the Administration of Foods and Medicines of the #EE.UU. Said agency #can assume the current functions of the Commission in matter of inspection and executive in relation with the veterinary legislation, phytosanitary and relative to the hygiene of the foods.
Gentleman President, before going in in matter and of *referirme to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the application of the program *ALTENER with arrangement to the procedure of *codecisión, a time approved the Treaty of *Amsterdam, #would want to express in the first place my satisfaction, my recognition, my gratitude by the support that the Commission has found in #all moment in the European Parliament precisely in the field of the renewable energies.
- OF Gentleman President, regarding the subject of the crop of the linen and the problems that there #be had in *España in this context, the Commission already proposed to the Council, in the frame of the package of prices for the year 1996, that established a maximum surface guaranteed for the crop of the linen and fixed some lower helps for the rest, except in the case of the linen *recolectado with traditional methods.
To these foundations it #would be necessary to add, in my opinion, the strategic value of the agriculture in #some exporting regions of the European Union, that, besides, have had in the Treaty of *Amsterdam a singular recognition, as they are the called regions *ultraperiféricas, that need a special consideration in the negotiations of the Round of the #Millenium so that the decisions that take  in *Seattle leave to except his agricultural interests and guarantee his social survival, cultural, economic and environmental, especially after the summit of Colony.
The European Parliament also has worked *denodadamente to put in vigour legislative norms that reduce the utilisation of gases of CO2; for example, the new directive of the European Union on the regulation of agents *contaminantes forces to the oil companies to engage  to achieve that the content of sulphur of the vehicles remain reduced to a third part, and that the content of sulphur of the fuel *diesel remain reduced to #one *séptima splits for the year 2005.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for *segunda reading *A5-00291999 of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position of the Council *COM98 285 - *C5-00291999 - *19980163COD with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the velocimeter of the vehicles of engine of two or three tyres and by the that modifies  the Directive *9261CEE of the relative Council to the homologation of said vehicles Speaker: Mr. *Ferri.
In front of the next negotiations with the *OMC, in the that goes  to include the audiovisual sector, sees  every time with greater clarity it important that are some independent and reliable informations on the situation of the market in *Europa for the attendants to adopt the political decisions, like the community organs, the Governments of the States members, for the organs *decisorios economic and social of the States members and of the regions and for the industry devoted to the investigation, the Universities and the media.
We believe that #if the Commission decides to advance in the review of the total of the directive on the ordination of the time of work and poses from the principle the subject of the rest *dominical, that has been a very debated subject and on the that already there are decisions of the European Court, simply run the danger of not to debate it never and to get another time to a dead end, for looking for *utópicamente it *inmejorable.
#One of the main political conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of Bosses of State or of Government signals the need, with seen to a true politics of migration, to go out of the traditional limits of the justice and the subjects of interior and resort to a series of instruments, in the field of other politics of the Union, conception #this that already advocated the Commission from 1994 and that always has deserved the support of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the Report *DEHAENE includes a proposal of scope historical. It pretends to divide the Treaties in two parts: a constitutional and institutional part that, as it has been the case up to now, only will be able to modify by unanimity by means of a Conference *Intergubernamental and a procedure of ratification of the States members, and a special part reserved to a series of politics concrete for the that the procedure of ratification substitutes  by the *dictamen satisfied of the Parliament.
The problem is not only that it register  an increase of the synthetic drugs and of the import of cocaine in *Europa, although the heroine follows being the main problem; it is that in the last years the drugs have converted  in a conscious threat that emanates of the relation among the crime organised with the traffic of drugs and with the traffic of arms and of nuclear materials, #as well as of the creation of new pertinent criminal organisations of the *Europa Central and Oriental.
These countries have been supported in his work by the International Agency of Atomic Energy, that has reviewed his analyses on the importance of the problem regarding a significant number of head offices; the Mrs. *Plooij-go *Gorsel has mentioned the works made up to now, and #this is my answer, Lady: the works of the Agency and of the countries that explode these head offices have not revealed to have problems of *bug in the essential systems for the security.
Also we request the *engarce of this philosophy *arancelaria with a new tax of similar structure to the old *APIM, so as to incorporate it to a package of measures specific of fiscal character that the Council, to proposal of the Commission, has to set up the next year -as they finish to indicate the deputies *Ripoll and *Martínez of *Bedoya and *Medina *Ortega- to *través of the announced permanent statute for the regions *ultraperiféricas -among the that find  the Canarian islands- like development of the article 299.2, that foresees a treatment differentiated, as *ustedes know, of the application of the disposals of the Treaty.
The case of *Corea is, as they already have said varied colleagues, the result of the combination of situations and factors, some interns, other external: the crisis of #Asia, the *hiperdesvalorización in more of the 30% of the national coin -of the *won- and the concomitant support of the #FMI have been the factors that have conducted to this eccentric only -situation, #can say- in that it finds  *Corea, by not talking of the disloyal form as *nos has taken the competition in the last times.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the communication of the Commission on the *salvaguardia of the current sportive structures and the maintenance of the social function of the sport in the community frames, the plan of support community to the fight against the doping in the sport and the participation of the Commission in the Anti-doping World-wide Agency.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00861999 of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, concerning the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the safe of civil responsibility derived of the circulation of vehicles cars and by the that modify  the Directives *73239CEE and *88357CEE *cuarta Managerial on safe of vehicles cars Speaker: *Rothley

*Permítanme say, to finish, that believe that it will have to exist an interrelationship, some relations among the scientists and the jurists and the evaluation of the factors of risk to guarantee with total security that the managers to draft the laws comprise it that say the scientists, and that the scientists are satisfied with the mood in that the jurists draft the laws so that they contemplate the criteria that *ellos have expressed in his *dictamen in the field of the evaluation of the factors of risk.
The elect deputies of the List *Bonino have treated to explain in an open letter to #all his *Señorías the reasons of this constitution, the reasons of the discriminations that they are object the No inscribed deputies in this Parliament and, in consequence, the reasons of our initiative, #as well as of #another that expect that it announce  what before, #this is, the proposal of modification of the Regulation, and especially *les has invited to vote with *nosotros against of this interpretation.
*Le Appreciate the interest and urge to the Commission to that it comprise with clarity that the question of *Timor goes to follow, by misfortune, slope during *algún time and demands urgency in the double humanitarian sense and in the political sense and of security, in the measure in that the announcement of the intervention of an international strength do not guarantees by himself\/hisself alone the conditions of security in the territory, because it will have to take part without condition of any class imposed by the #indonesian authorities and the urgency of the humanitarian support is URGENCY in own sense.
I do not have of sufficient time to develop the subject, but wanted to call the attention of the Commission on the need, no only of preventive actions, but also to hold responsible to #all the official controllers, to #all the experts, with the end that the principle of caution do not convert  in a principle of irresponsibility for #that that have the duty to watch by the alimentary security and the health of the consumers.
Regarding the possibility for the countries in roads of development to access to the technicians of the commercial liberalisation, to the *OMC and to his groups of experts, #etcetera, is truth, as it has said , that #this poses a problem: said goal is not, for the moment, near at hand of #many of *ellos, and the utilisation of these complex mechanisms is reserved for those countries that have of means, of here our proposal of a technical assistance mentioned in the document of the Commission so that these countries #can by himself\/hisself same possess and use the necessary juridical technology.
The Council recognises, the same that the European Parliament, in the first place, that the politics of equality of opportunities for men and women follows being very important; second, that the program of action constitutes the community instrument more valuable for the fulfillment of the obligations contracted in the program of action of the Conference of *Pekín and, finally, that the best way to achieve a realisation with hit is integrating the perspective of equality of opportunities for men and women in #all class of politics.
In front of the flagrant *incumplimiento of it had in said Regulation, the delays incurred in the communications of the lists, the increase of number of ships that use #that *artes, the damages to the *pesquería of the tuna and to the marine ecosystem, the grave economic damages to the fishermen of the *Cantábrico Northwest and the total fault of answer of the EU to the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna *ICCAT against the overexploitation of this species:
With #everything, although we consider the proposal of resolution common too much bent to the hypothesis of the aerial missile more that to the of an artefact planted in the interior and, especially, although we consider the own proposal too much indulgent and diplomatic with the #italian political authorities, share the need to ask at last the cooperation of #all the States members of the European Union so that they facilitate it that went *menester for a timely and suitable deepening of the investigations, so as to that #can discover  the *ejecutores, the *inductores and the reasons of this absurd slaughtering.
Gentleman President, in my own name and in the of other members of the Parliament, although respecting fully the solemn character of the session of today, wanted to signal a question of order relative to the article 19 of the Regulation, based in the worry by the human rights, since the visit of today of the President of *Colombia limits  to his address in front of the Parliament until the official dinner with the bosses of the political groups.
*Tampere Has shown that the Union has the political intention to trace common politics in questions that are intimately tied to the daily life, as it is to reinforce the feeling of security of the citizens by means of the fight against the crime organised, especially in the drugs, in the wash of money and in the traffic of human beings, with the judicial cooperation and the mutual recognition of the decisions.
It is necessary to highlight likewise the need that the Union subject his interventions in this matter to a more rigid control and establish systems of review so much of the implication and of the information to the #sindical representatives of the workers, as of the effective goodness no only economic, but also social of said interventions, had account that no always the helps of the Union to the companies have had like answer the stable development of the activities of #the same and the *salvaguardia of his taxes of employment.
*Yo Believe that it pertinent, taking into account, besides, that the report of the Court of Accounts produces a series of consequences on the own parliamentary activity -and think particularly in the approval of the management-, it that we have to take, is *plantearle to the President of the Court of Accounts it that has occurred, reach that it engage  publicly, apart from presenting excuses #if *ello was pertinent, to an investigation to be able to control this subject, that improve  the system of distribution and information to the Parliament, but, in any case, understand that, at the end, it that go to take is *sancionarnos to *nosotros same through this behaviour.
Therefore, it is our duty, in this end of century, *preguntarnos on these millions of boys that are subjected to the prostitution, that  *suicidan, that drug  and, in moments in that our continent hardly #if it begins to discover the *estragos of the *pedofilia, in front of the that during *muchísimo time have closed the eyes, owe *preguntarnos #which is the cause that, in our democratic countries and economically developed, that #all the years celebrate with pride a new anniversary of the Statement of the the Rights of the Man, these same rights see  *pisoteados until this point *cuando refer  to the feeblest, is to say, to our boys.
In addition to the three points mentioned of the Statements of Colony, have arisen in different fields, among other questions, the Court of Justice of the *CE, the Court of Accounts, the distribution of the seats of the Parliament, the flexibility and the division in two parts of the Treaty of creation of the *CEE. In our report will present, in base the conversations kept and to the points of sight received, our own visions on it that consider that it is possible and recommended.
To #that *respecto, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, *permítaseme present an example: #if in the Council there was a modification in the weighting of the votes, in the that, in fact, the countries with more population and the greater countries had more can, and the enlargement of the qualified majority to the process of *codecisión took that this tendency stressed  also in the European Parliament, ask: #which will be the paper in this *Europa of the small countries or of the poor countries of the European Union?
. IN In the weeks that have preceded to the agreement on this resolution, #a lot of deputies of the European Parliament have procured to achieve that the attitude of the Union *propicie really a Round of the Development in the *OMC, that the countries in development have the possibility to be associated of right plenary in the process of negotiation, and stand out that the benefits of the trade have to centre in the fight against the *agravación of the poverty in our world.
With the argument of the enlargement -#whose materialisation no *nos poses problems of principle, but no *nos seems that it #can carry out without measuring the consequences, in diverse levels- and in name of the efficiency and the democracy, pretends  a modification of the Treaties in particular in the institutional sphere: abandonment of the unanimity and enlargement to new spheres of the decisions by qualified majority, new weighting of the votes in the decisions of the Council by qualified majority and modification of the composition and of the operation of the institutions number of Commissioners, Presidency of the Council, composition of the *PE or even consecration of the tongues of work...
The industry, the States Members and the Commission have to collect #all the necessary information to prepare and present a complaint on the regulation of the commercial tariffs and evaluate the suitability to resort to the action of the *OMC, the Commission has to continue his efforts of supervision of the market in cooperation with the industry and, finally, #all the parts involved have to encourage for establishing a field of action for the sector.
By this reason, *yo believe that the Conference *Intergubernamental occupies a central place inside the triangle formed by the enlargement, the Conference *Intergubernamental and the external politics and of security. In this context, also has to remain absolutely clear that in any moment, already was with 12 or with 13 candidates to the adhesion, #can admit  any deviation of the criteria of *Copenhague, and this Assembly do not goes to allow that it produce  and do not goes to ratify any treaty in this sense.
Especially, also it has reached  an agreement -the Parliament also conceded #a lot of importance to this look, *justificadamente to my seem- that it answers to #one *constatación political important, to know, that the tasks of the European Union in *Kosovo and in the region of the *Balcanes are tasks of varied years and that his fulfillment in the financial look #can require an increase of the costs in the field of the external politics regarding the planned at the beginning of this year, on the base of a distinct political situation.
In the first place, the European Parliament; of course, the no governmental organisations, and in this point, and since it has posed  the question, want to say that the movement of the woman and the no governmental organisations have exerted and exert a paper *excepcionalmente important and have been really the strengths *motrices of the politics that have gone  configuring in the #european field; and, of course, they will take part also the Commission, with #many of his services, the states members, and the Presidency.
Challenge to the #scottish minister of Agriculture to that it evade *Londres and support the request of the Scottish Nationalist Party, that delivered yesterday to the #french Government, in the sense that the #french authorities study thoroughly and with character of urgency the scientific proofs, the capacity to determine his origin and the situation of the labeling in *Escocia; and I take a call to #all the #french colleagues of this Assembly so that they defend this line in front of his Government.
An important part of the process of enlargement of the European Union are the different programs of existent cooperation among the Union and the aspiring countries to the adhesion, and the point of game is precisely the improvement of the economy of these countries of face to create possibilities of employment in his own territories, so that his inhabitants do not see  forced to emigrate by economic reasons.
Like solution offers  the #french rule, the *cual, as I complement of the national diet of fixed price, contains likewise relative disposals to the import, export and *reimportación, is compatible with the Right of the European Union and has shown his efficiency in the practice. Thus, gentleman Commissioner, the European Parliament, above his division in political Groups, as it will be able to check easily, expects the green light for a rule of character legal or contractual in *Alemania and *Austria to put good end once and for all to this interminable history.
I believe that #if there #be a reasonable solution from a point of sight economic, with the that the publishers agree; #if there #be a solution that takes into account the diverse linguistic fields and cultural; #if there #be a solution that neither comport the greatest restriction of the competition in application of the prohibition of *sopesar contained in the article 85, then are in the correct path to give with a suitable rule.
More even, although the poured direct of industrial materials, included the military deposit of residual ammunitions, is a practice that has been amply abandoned by the States members, the locations of these poured follow constituting a real threat for the resources *pesqueros and, in #some occasions, for example, no very far of my own coast, *Beaufort *Dyke, a threat for the human security and, often, the lives of the fishermen are in danger, to the equal that are it the health and the welfare of the persons that visit the coast or well live there.
Finally, I believe that it has got the moment that they adopt  the proposals to the *respecto presented by #Grecia, among the that include  the materialisation of the fast access of the citizen to the justice by means of the resource to alternative procedures, like the mediation and the action *conciliatoria before the trial, #as well as the creation of a system harmonised of public order and of resolution of differences, based in the principles of freedom and democracy, and in the respect of the fundamental freedoms and the state of right.
The answer of the Commissioner *Nielson went of it more wanders, and *me surprises to check that today the European Parliament have been able to give green light to the signature of this agreement of *librecambio, *cuando even the principle of the protection of the denominations of origin is not clearly recognised in the annex of the agreement neither establishes  guarantee #any regarding the evolution of the imports of type #zero and to his consequences on the group of the sector *vitivinícola #european.
Postpone the approval of this agreement *interinstitucional or, it that it #would be still worse, not to approve it, and, therefore not being able to apply it in our internal field, #would plant in a very embarrassing situation to the European Parliament, a situation that #would lessen the fine work that this Parliament has made with regard to reestablishing the credibility of the European Union in the questions referents to the fraud and to the bad financial management.
Regarding the #others lines of the relative budget to the external actions of the category 4 of the financial perspectives, a reduction of the fixed amount of the assignments attributed goes to avert, to his time, that adopt  decisions precipitated on the rectification of the maximum limits of this category, because, as I already have said, the evaluation of the real needs of the reconstruction has not concluded still.
Without damage of the positive results that to a large extent finishes to underline the President in exercise of the Council, #can not leave to recognise that in #some points the Commission expresses some disappointment. The Commission regrets that the European Council did not adopt the concept of system only of asylum, that corresponds, to our understand, to an ambition, but also to the need *imperiosa to tackle the questions of asylum of collective and coherent form.
We want to report also the attempt of activation of the games allocated to *Turquía, in the frame of the union *aduanera and of the impulse to the relations *euroturcas; parallel attempt to the presentation of proposals for the approval of the corresponding juridical base necessary, *cuando is known that the situation of the human rights has not improved in *Turquía, that keeps  #the same politics regarding the question *kurda, that keeps  the occupation of a big sector of *Chipre.
In the report asks  also to the Commission that support the process of integration of these environmental goals in the energetic politics by means of investigations on the repercussions of the climatic change and on #all the possible technologies, by means of investigations to determine the best indicators with seen to calibrate the attainments in the reduction of the broadcasts and by means of the presentation of reports periodic to the Parliament.
This proposal constitutes the first, and only the first, of these measures, because it offers uniform norms on the competition of the courts of the States members in matter of divorce and separation, #as well as in matter of relative processes to the regulation of the parental responsibility, and offers also a clear and coherent frame for a fast and practically automatic recognition in each #one of the States members of the decisions adopted in another Been member in the field of the application of the regulation.
To the *respecto, the bilateral agreement that the States Joined have signed with Chinese to prepare the entry of this last in the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, has to consider by the European Union, apart from an important contribution to the process *multilateral, also and especially a fundamental moment to check the substantial weight that the human rights have and will have in front of the opportunities that offers a market that enjoys of enormous potentialities like the Chinese.
We are *precipitándonos in a road without exit when despising the prerogatives of the deputies, when despising the history of the parliamentarism of the European Union and of #all his States members and, as we do not want to correct an error that committed six months ago, are had to institutionalise the delation in our Parliament, to allow that any assistant or civil servant of this Parliament take a complaint, because it suspect that the premium of the coined of *Fulano or *Mengano have committed maybe a fraud!
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00631999 of the Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the communication of the Commission to the Council, to the European Parliament, to the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions on a plan of action of the European Union in matter of fight against the drug 2000-2004 *COM1999 239 - *C5-00931999 - *19992095COS
The Commission prefers, as, that his manager call  Mr. *Brittan or Mr. *Lamy, *mermar by anticipated our positions on the principle of caution, the sanitary security and the protection of the environment, #as well as the economic interests of the rural zones, and, in the frame of the banana, loan *poca attention to the traditional and privileged relations that our countries keep, in the frame of commitments international, with the countries *ACP.
For *nosotros, the introduction, in the resolution, of a specific reference to the principle of the sovereignty of the States #would have involved the risk to put in *entredicho the attainments of the system of the Nations Joined and, specifically, of the world-wide Conference of 1993, that had that the promotion and the protection of #all the human rights is a legitimate worry of the international community.
Without embargo, have to think once again, *Señorías, that the report foresees that, #if we adopt the text, the financial cooperation #can suspend in case of a rape of the democratic principles of the State of Right, of the human rights or of the fundamental freedoms do not means #this that #if today we concede the financial advantages, the slat in matter of human rights, #etcetera, already has fixed  and that, in consequence, only a shrinking concerning the current situation #can give place to the suspension?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, although the two regulations that today debate  do not have, in reality, any relation with the debate that will take place next Monday in the Council of Subjects General and some days afterwards in the European Council of *Helsinki, *yo comprise, of course, that #can not dispense of the political and temporary context and that, obviously, are forced to consider also, together with said regulations, the general problem of the relation of the European Union with *Turquía and vice versa, #such as they already have taken the majority of the orators this afternoon.
Regarding the amendment 9 on the content of the annual report, the speaker wants to add an article to clear the content of this report that, among other things, will have to comprise an analysis of the influence of the actions of the manufacturers and of the factors related with the strategy for the tourisms and the dioxide of carbon in the eventual changes that produce  in the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon.
Only I #can confirm that it is a positive answer to the challenge of the will of the States members to struggle against the fraud, to put order in his own house, to improve the systems of control, a challenge that, as we signal in the annual report, #can that this year it was still greater, although neither by a moment diminishes the paper and the responsibility of the Commission in this context.
Without embargo, already has  of a very precise study of the World-wide Bank and the relative Commission to reconstruction of *Kosovo, of the *cual gives off clearly that the total of resources financial pertinent of the external help required will be of 2.300 millions of dollars, or of euros, during the next years, since in addition to the damages caused by the war, exist other damages accumulated because of the disastrous repercussions of the political situation of the last years for the persons of *Kosovo.

is not the moment of *analizarlas in detail, but want to underline that the relative problems to the assignment of the budgetary resources, to the protection of the financial interests of the Union, to the fight against the fraud, to the management of the agreements or to the decentralisation constitute subjects that involve solutions and answers that need of the active cooperation of the European Parliament and also, and especially, of the States members gathered in the Council of Ministers.
We want to call his attention on questions like the following: #if it takes  seriously the right of self-determination of the villages, #this involves also that they have to take seriously the constitutional parliaments of the States members, of the regions, of the cultural communities, and that will occupy a place in the *Europa subsidiary of the future, because the right of self-determination is a holy principle for #all the villages of the world and *eso do not comports exclusively to the States, since the concepts no always coincide.
To which it is necessary to add other 45 millions of euros that will disburse  during the next three years in the frame of a special budgetary line devoted to the countries in development of the different regions of the world, to the equal that 20 millions euros allocated to a regional program *quinquenal for the countries *ACP and other additional bottoms in the frame of programs *indicativos, directed #among others to the countries *ACP, without explaining besides, for example, the *cofinanciación of organisations no governmental or of a program of investigation.
But, as it has said very well the Mr. *Patten, do not owe *subestimar the difficulties that still threaten in the horizon, that surely *nos will take to drop in critical situations - *ojalá *pasajeras - in the that #all had to have especially presents two considerations: in *primer term, that the method to follow advancing has to be always a sincere dialogue, opened and direct among the parts and, second, that, anyway, #israeli and Palestinians share an enemy -the terrorism- expressed in #any one of his forms, that do not has another goal that the destruction of the peace, of the freedom and of the respect of the human rights.
A wanton mind #can, firstly, signal to the Commission that this sentence *nos removes our illusions, since *nosotros thought -knows God #if we are not fed up to hear it- that it was to the European Union to the that *le owed, from 50 years ago, the stability, the economic growth, the peaceful solution of the *litigios, #etcetera; but a simply curious mind #can ask to the Commission it that thinks on purpose of the continuous decline, decade after decade, of the annual tax of half growth of the countries developed.
#If I listen to the Council, to the Commission and to the Deputies of this Parliament, seem  rather to some hedgehogs taking the love; with fear to puncture  and knowing that in #all the important subjects -and step to *enumerarlos once again-, the social looks commented still by the Mr. *Hansenne, the sustainable development, the culture, the preventive principle in the feeding, the agricultural file, the countries in roads of development, the welfare of the animals, seems that we are #all simply of agreement.

The three main conflicts, relative to the sector of the banana, to the production and to the incorporation of organisms modified genetically and to the import of meat of bovine North American, finish to be arbitrated by the own Commission, against of the interests of the producers of bananas #european and of the countries *ACP, against of the interests of the #european consumers and, of course, against of the interests of our graziers and of our agriculturalists.

Specifically, after having suffered during 78 days the inclement bombardments of the NATO, with active participation of the European Union, this village suffers today, with the pretext of the democratisation of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia, an inhuman blackmail: it has to demolish to his legitimate government so that it was raised the embargo of fuels and so that they concede  the games for the reconstruction of what was destroyed by it bombardments of the NATO and of the European Union.

After having said that the economic politics European has like goal the employment, after decreeing it and declaim it high and strong, without verifying in any moment of way realistic and pragmatic it justified of this affirmation, records  in the marble of the treaties a relation of subordination among it economic and it social, that finishes reducing #this last to a management of the competition of #all and of each #one by a place of work in a labour market increasingly reduced.

The pretence is to achieve a backrest first to the proposal that go to pose -so much to the Commission as, in his moment, #if the Commission the takes #his, to the Council of Ministers and to the Parliament- precisely for no only follow forward in the incorporation of the Commission to *Eurocontrol, but also advance in it that it is the field of the fifteen countries to treat to achieve an only space and, therefore, a common management of this only space of the fifteen countries.
*Eso Supposes that the Mr. #Solana no only will have to occupy of the most immediate dimension of the prevention of #crisis, but also -and #any experience has in *ello- of our paper in relation with the world, is to say, with the Nations Joined, with the Round of the #Millenium, with the future of the #FMI and of the *FAO; also it is important in the measure in that the Europeans, building the Union, also are taking *algo important for the future of the humanity and for his stability.
In this way it has reinforced  even more, #if it fits, the guarantee that already appeared in #a lot of parts of the text, of the full respect of the Protocol on the privileges and the immunities -of the *cual want to mention especially the article 10 that it is very precise and exhaustive- #as well as of the relative planned norms in the article 6 of the Regulation that, in application of the orientations of the Protocol, in the article that finish to mention, regulates with more precision, #if it fits, the immunities of the deputies.
Regarding the minimum age my opinion is that we have to *atenernos to the commitment on the minimum age of 14 years, that was it suited in previous negotiations, with the amendment of the Parliament that leaves very seated that the taking of prints digital has to effect of compliance with the European Agreement for the Protection of the Human Rights and with the Convention of the Nations Joined on the Rights of the Boy.
How another thing #can mean the attempt of generalisation of the system of majorities and the substantial suppression, and maybe even formal, of the right of veto, in spite of the knowingly interposed complaints *cual curtain of smoke, but the limitation of the possibilities of intervention of the popular element, at least *cuando #this  *opone to the options of the capital in the smallest «countries»?
3 in consequence, accepts, when giving white letter to the Commission to propose it, a readjustment of the weight of the States, in the trail of it that already is *sucediendo in the administrative and functional organisation of the community executive, that puts in *entredicho the constitutive and historical principle of the #european project that always has based , with hit, in the fault of *proporcionalidad among the population and the weighting of the votes;
Sure enough, we have considered that #some of the numerous amendments presented by the countries to the *cuales our position poses problems are, in our opinion, unacceptable, especially the #tending amendment to incorporate in this resolution a reference to the section 7 of the article 2 of the Letter of the Nations Joined, in virtue of the *cual any disposal of the present Letter authorises to the Nations Joined to take part in the subjects that are essentially of the national competition of a State.
I want to, without embargo, call the attention on the fact that it #would be timely that #all the costs, #all the men, #all the means employed in the past to watch the internal borders of the European Union - for example, among #Italia and *Francia, *Francia and *Alemania, #etcetera, or was, among the #european States that now have a common border - employed  in the external borders of the European Union, so as to combat better this phenomenon of delinquency and of illegal immigration.
Therefore, my invitation goes directed to #all #that that believe in #this dip, in these goals - and here have in front of *nosotros to the President *Prodi that has declared it in reiterated occasions and that know that it believes in *ello - an invitation to be decided, determined; an invitation to the European Parliament so that, immediately after finalising the Summit of *Helsinki - #if, as I fear, the conclusion will be an advance, but too much limited - gather  and with big opening, with big value assume #all his determinations saying in this moment and thinking, as in other moments of the #european history, that the Parliament has in front of himself\/hisself a big opportunity and a big task.
The first has reached  with the inclusion of the products of the aquaculture and the *marisqueo, for the that it was not foreseen any help to the commercialisation, *cuando #both are *subsectores that they have to remain, to the equal that the fishing, fully included in a system #whose goal is to adapt the offer to the demand and *cuando, as in the case of the aquaculture, are sectors in roads of growth that have to have a fine planning of the production already from the beginning to avert, in it possible, crisis like the that periodically suffer, for example, the producers of salmon.
Even the *anunciadísima total suppression of the rights of customs in the products of the no developed countries goes to accelerate the *usurpación of the wealth of these countries, whereas, on the other hand, will flood the market with cheap articles that will displace the corresponding articles of countries like the #mine. The World-wide Organisation of Trade has not created  to protect the interests, neither the of the villages neither the of the workers.
The Commission will go by the road that the Parliament recommended already takes time, that the Mr. *Karlsson finishes also to show and that *yo same signalled also in August in my answers by writing to the parliamentary questions, in concrete, the trip to the administration of those functions of control financial that they are competent for the programs of the cost, is to say, decentralisation and with *ello, to #the same time, increase of the financial responsibility in the administrative services that make the costs.
Support absolutely this systematic *follow *up and, in consequence, celebrate to a large extent that the Commission in the frame of his package of reform for the financial management have decided to give to this systematic *follw *up a fixed structure so that in the future was possible to take advantage of of real way for the improvement of the financial management the precisions of the Court of Accounts. For this wide project of reforms ask the support of the European Parliament.
Also it wanted to appeal to #that that have the possibility to benefit  of the program #Socrates, that #can take advantage of the possibilities of training, that go to be able to follow forming in the future, so that they contribute to that *Europa grow jointly, so that in the course of his training recognise that we #can not, with our vertiginous rhythm that presents  at present in the development of #all the programs, is to say, that to #all #that that #can not advance so fast *les take of the hand, since the quality, the level and the training also demand that we do not give sideways to the feeblest.
We consider that an important opportunity to examine the concrete contribution of the Union to the creation of new places of work in *Europa the will provide the next summit of *Lisboa in March, that will be the moment and the place to take an evaluation of the three processes that finish to mention -Colony, *Luxemburgo and *Cardiff-, by a part, and, by #another, to formulate the strategy, the synthesis of the politics *macroeconómicas, the innovation *microeconómica business and the imperative of the new society of the information.
This plan proposes likewise measures allocated to different sectors of consumers designed to improve the sensitisation on the consumption of energy, the experience and the practice in fields #such like acquisition of appliances, the consumption of energy in the home, the facilities of buildings, the systems of heating and the management of the energy in the industry, the sector of the services and also the public sector.
Gentleman President, on a question of order: although tonight no *nos accompanies the representative of the Council, *permítaseme ask #if the Commission or a representative of the secretariat of the Parliament know the reports of an agency of press that have seen, according to the *cuales yesterday adopted  in the Council the decision of *prorrogar the voluntary plan during 12 months, with it that overlooked  the procedure of *codecisión and this debate and the vote of morning result irrelevant.
Gentleman President, the most palpable character, in our opinion, of the European Council that finishes to celebrate  in *Helsinki is the absence of #all political vision on a long-term basis of the bosses of State and of government, that have decided an enlargement of an unpublished importance with the possible addition of thirteen new members, without giving in any moment the conceptual tools that allowed to imagine the able institutional structures of *asumirla.
By #this ask to the Parliament, to the Council, to the Commission and to the Nations Joined that they do not recognise the diet of the Talibans and that promote a plan of action in favour of the no governmental organisations that operate in *Afganistán after the fundamental freedoms of the #afghan women and his economic and social emancipation and in favour of the no governmental organisations that help to the #afghan women refugees.
But although they #can not  take schematic analyses, *yo #can not *obviar in this context a comment: the Common Agricultural Politics and the World-wide Organisation of the Trade are promoting increasingly the research of a competitiveness exacerbated like fundamental element, thing that *me seems absolutely worrisome because this type of *sacralización of the competitiveness above #everything it other surely conducts to practices of risk, like the utilisation of hormones or antibiotics, for example, among the matters prevail for the animal feeding.
Like immediate measure, the control of the organisations of assistance technical is carrying out of form more rigorous and specific, and the radical reform will ensure the meridian definition of the core of the functions of service public of the civil servants of the Commission and the effective supervision and the responsible management of the executive agencies.
In this frame, have to express the enormous worry that feels my Group in front of the debate that will celebrate  in *Tampere on the police cooperation, the fight against the drugs, the protection of data, the democratic control of *Europol and the System of Information of *Schengen. We fear once again that the participants will not give the size in these important points that have a deep impact on the democracy in *Europa.
It do not treats  only to ensure, in the frame of the globalisation of the economy, an able growth to create durable and sustainable employment, or to propose an institutional reform in depth of face to the next Conference *Intergubernamental; neither it treats  only to carry forward the subject of the enlargement of the Union to contribute, like this, to the welfare of the *Europa global, in spite of the importance *innegable of these challenges.
The European Council in Colony examined the capacity of *Europa to carry out the functions established in the article 17 of the Treaty of the Union, calls of *Petersberg, functions related with the humanitarian help and with the measures of rescue and pacification, #as well as with the definition of the mission of the groups of fight in the control of the crises, included the pacification, a time that *Europa have solvent military means.
Among #others, the suffering and the death of members productive of his societies and -thing very important- the *apartamiento of the women of the employment to devote  to loan cares and the deviation of resources of the families and the communities to devote the savings to pay the costs of attention of health and, in fact, as it has to know, sure, *usted, the incessant burials that see in countries like *Zimbabwe, #if *te remain stopped in the corner of a street.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner *Lamy, gentleman Minister *Sasi, the Round of the #Millenium will have to promote necessarily forms of cooperation and integration among the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the International Organisation of the Work, the International Monetary Bottom and the World-wide Bank, so as to that the liberalisation of the commercial exchanges go accompanied of a renewed stability of the monetary market, of politics of full employment of the human resources, of networks of social protection and of the respect generalised of the fundamental labour norms.
Lady Speaker, have written  #a lot of beautiful words after the celebrated summit in *Tampere; nevertheless, the fundamental premise so that these beautiful words convert  in reality, is to say, so that they fulfil  the principles humanists, is of course that the persons #can go in in Strong *Europa, that begin of serious form to put in practice a politics in the that it was possible to separate the politics of asylum of the immigration, that begin  to put in practice a serious politics of collaboration with the *ACNUR to end to solve the problems of the refugees of *Europa and of the world.
On the question of the fundamental rights, the creation of the frame that allow to this Parliament take his contribution to the preparation of a letter is an element, but go to celebrate debates on the bottom, as, for *nosotros, this letter has to have direct effects, is to say, that the citizens have to can *invocarla to appeal to the Court of Justice and this letter has to *versar on new rights for the Europeans of the century *XXI.
I expect then, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, that the European Commission obtain a mandate of his institution regarding the development of these rights of the citizens of third countries, and that #this develop  in the widest sense, according to the respect of the principle of no discrimination, also *cuando treat  of the right of vote, the right to live in family and the right to the free circulation of persons, even *cuando the Summit has not manifested  on *ello.
*IT The fact that the Commission have exhausted the last term to ask the fixation of a date for the negotiation is, definitely, regrettable, especially to the sight of the global course of #all the question that already in the previous years saw to arise a conflict in the institutional frame of the query with reference to the paper of the Parliament in an agreement that has important budgetary repercussions.
In particular, the fault of consensus on the content of the politics *macroeconómicas in the previous period to the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Maastricht and of the first orientations of economic politics played a fundamental paper in the amplification of the negative effects, of the external crashes and in the development of obstacles greater to the growth and to the employment.
But today, remembering *algo that said here in the last Plenary -with *Tampere launches  the signal to the #european citizens that *Europa has left to be only a market-, to me *me #would enjoy to say #alto and clear that, with this strategic document on the inner market that  *nos has presented to the Parliament and that it is today object of this intervention, the citizen goes to have a clear idea of the coherence of this market and that this market has like last and main protagonist *él same.
The participation of the European Parliament *nos seems fundamental, no only because in the #european construction the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission constitute the three points of the triangle that have to conform a construction balanced, but also because the popular representatives gathered in this Parliament are the most indicated to transmit the opinion of the citizens that, after all, is it that matters, so that the Commission #can take out the timely conclusions.
In #one misses  an approach *macroeconómico, in #another is missing the realisation of reforms structural, in the third, there #be not an adjust among the economic politics and the politics of employment. It is evident that have increased the preventive measures as, for example, the insertion of the unemployed of long length in the market of work, or active measures as, for example, stimuluses to the research of work and to the creation of places of work.
It goes the Commission to adopt in this time of negotiations, in the possible decisions of commitment, the necessary measures so that it apply  it that *usted has announced during the audiences in his nomination, is to say, the test and the labeling for the meat of *vacuno, that by it other goes to be compulsory already from the 1-1-2000, #if we do not get to another regulation in relation with the suspension of this prohibition of import and his *imposición in front of the countries that have agreed the prohibitions of import?
Subject: Law *HelmsBurton Has had knowledge the Commission of the demonstrations taken by the Secretary of State of the States Joined, Mrs. *Albright, relative to the impossibility by part of the Congress of the #EE.UU. To modify the title *IV of the Law *Helms-*Burton, breaking like this #one of the essential elements of the Agreement among the European Commission and the Administration #Clinton, in the new frame of the Transatlantic Summit among #EE.UU. And the European Union of May of 1998?
Gentleman President, ask the word to remember once again that, from the principle of the term of office, the radical deputies do not take part in the votes neither the Plenary neither in the commissions. And #this to call the attention of the Presidency and of his *Señorías on the fact that to a part of the deputies  *le denies the possibility to contribute with #the same rights and #the same means, to the parliamentary life.
Subject: Restrictions to the freedom of navigation imposed by *Turquía On 27 May 1997, the #turkish authorities adopted a Decision registered with the number 2646 and signed by the Secretary of State of Maritime Subjects, Mr. *Nazmi *Kumral, in virtue of the *cual forbids  the access to *Turquía of #all those fuselages *mercantes with #cypriot pavilion or that belong to *armadores Cypriots or of other nationalities, included the of the States members of the European Union, *cuando his place of origin or of destination was *algún port of the free zone of the Republic of *Chipre.
This discussion that have had in the Commission of Subjects Constitutional relative to the road so that any possible illegal activity was put in knowledge of the *OLAF, believe that *nos has carried to find the suitable road, because a political organ has to have a filter that examine #if sure enough these informations are or no founded and #if they attack or no against the immunity or the inviolability of word that have the deputies.
Of this way will be able to have of financial assistance with charge to the community budget for the reception, the integration and the voluntary return of the refugees, the persons displaced and the applicants of asylum and will have an important instrument that gives a human dimension to the politics of asylum of the Union, as #one of the deputies finishes to ask takes some moments.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, had wished that the debate and the vote of this report had not taken place necessarily today, because *nosotros -and #this want to say it to the principle of my intervention -, because of the circumstances that *nos have forced to modify the agenda, and because of the fact that the hour of votes has extended  so much owing to the long length of the reports *Napolitano, *Leinen, *Dimitrakopoulos and *Schwaiger that the report of the Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou will vote it tomorrow early.
In accordance with the philosophy that inspires the new diet of the regions *ultraperiféricas -that besides has confirmed the European Council of Colony asking to the Commission that before 31 December present measures for the regions *ultraperiféricas- in this moment the incorporation of these regions to the European Union do not happens necessarily by a harmonisation *arancelaria and fiscal, but that allows a treatment differentiated, for example the maintenance of the *octroi of *mer in the #french departments of *Ultramar and the of special diets in *Azores and *Madeira.
Another question that have to consider *cuando talk of the construction of ships new is the problem of the waste and the means to treat the waste, and no only *me refer to the waste that derive  of the operation of the ships but also to the rubbish produced during the trip, because the pollution of the sea is an important fed up question and the ships are in very fine responsible measure of *ella.
I coincide fully in his assessment that it is absolutely necessary to reaffirm the international presence of the European Union in the international scene, especially in the looks of security and defence, for the that the #finnish Presidency -and it is necessary to say it with legitimate pride- has given a decisive impulse with this historical meeting of ministers of External Subjects and of ministers of Defence, that is the first time that produces  in the history of the European Union.
*Yo Always repeat that *Turquía already #would have advanced more in the approximation to *Europa #if it had adopted before, in the timely moment, other more radical measures in the field of the human rights, of the rights of the minorities, especially regarding the problem *kurdo, and of the democracy in the frame of the relations with #Grecia, and had contributed to the solution of the problem of *Chipre.
With the time, obviously, #any one that request it and fulfil with the requirements will find a place in the political level; without embargo, #if today we do not proceed quickly in this sense and think in expanding bending almost the number of the States members without institutional reforms *meditadas and checked -no longer there #be time to experience- condemn to death to the dream of #one *Europa political able to respect the identities, the cultures and the traditions and to contribute, nevertheless, to create a new model of #european citizen.
Also they have to  value with #a lot of caution the improvements ascertained by the Commission and the Presidency of the Council in the interior of *Turquía, #if have present the ratification of the conviction of death of the Mr. *Ocalan, that the awarded with the Prize *Sajarov *Leyla *Zana continues imprisoned for having claimed his right to the freedom of opinion, the fault of solution to the problem *kurdo and all it that expresses  in said document in relation with the progresses of *Turquía.
- Proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Protocol for the adaptation of the institutional looks of the European Agreement among the European Communities and his States members, by a part, and *Rumanía, by #another, to take into account the adhesion of the Republic of *Austria, of the Republic of *Finlandia and of the Realm of *Suecia to the European Union 97301999 - *C5-01951999 - *19970277AVC Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Security and Political of Defence
Support that the taxes of the heavy transports are taxed in accordance with his real level of pollution and that the destination of these amounts devote  to investments in the railway and to investments in the transport combined among road and railway and, finally, aim the idea to deliver the 91% of the permissions that do not distribute  according to an equal quota among #all the States members attending no only to the needs of the transport in himself\/hisself same but also considering the origin and the destination, for example, of the commodities that cross pertinent Swiss of airports or ports like *Hamburgo, *Rotterdam, *Génova or *Marsella.
The Council, after having examined the proposal of the Commission directed to postpone during a year of 1 January to 31 December 2000 the introduction of a compulsory system of labeling of the meat of bovine and keep during this period the plan of labeling voluntary established in the Regulation *CE *nº 82097, has adopted the following conclusions:
Gentleman President, for me the greater problem that presents the text that go to vote tomorrow -finish to collect it in the distribution- resides in the article 3 of the proposal of the Commission, according to the *cual #would forbid these substances inside the European Union -pray to the Commission that *me listen, because I want to ask an explanation-; as *eso, it that #would vote is that we forbid these substances inside the European Union, but admit that this prohibition do not affect to his manufacture and commercialisation inside the European Union, since the #would send to another Been member with seen to the export to third countries.
The Scientific Committee on the Health and the Animal Welfare approved on 10 March 1999 his report on the looks of the utilisation of *somatotropina bovine relative to the animal welfare and declared that the *BST increases the risk of *mastitis clinical and the length of his treatment, increases the incidence of disorders in the legs, #can affect negatively to the reproduction and induce varied severe reactions in the zone of the injection.
Regretting that the Council have decided to accept to *Turquía like candidate to the adhesion, expect that, at least, do not give  new steps while his Government have not adopted the necessary measures in the field of the human rights, of the international right regarding the delimitation of borders, of the application of the resolutions of the Nations Joined on *Chipre and of a political solution for the question *kurda;
Although obviously I #can not force to my colleague the Mrs. *Loyola of Palace, that in these moments is *felizmente deputy in this Parliament, regarding his politics and his relations with this Assembly, do not is missing the one who considers that it has got the hour that the Commission and the Parliament deepen in his negotiations on the procedures and the conventions of this Assembly that, as it is known, gathers  in more of a place, #as well as on the conventions and the procedures of the School.
To the sight of these circumstances, wanted to *recalcar once again that the problem of the refugees no only has not resolved , but that converts  each day in more dramatic, as I have been able to check in my recent trips to the fields of refugees #palestinian in *Líbano, *Jordania and Syrian, #as well as in the distinct reports of the *OOPS and of the Mr. *Menéndez of the Valley, in his quality of Representative of the humanitarian help of the European Union in *Jordania.
With #everything, want to say simply that congratulate to #all his *Señorías by his interventions, because *algo has emerged with strength: further of the rapidity with that it is necessary to carry out the program, it important is that the European Union and the European Parliament exert a very active paper, very strong so that in Orient Half, and especially among Palestinian and #Israel, establish  a stable and durable peace, so as to find a solution to the problem of the refugees and so that a #palestinian State #can live peacefully with the #israeli State.
They exist two basic principles of the operation of the *OMC: by a part, the discrimination, impassable, among products #whose processes of production are different -*me refer to the environmental conditions or the social conditions in the *cuales elaborates  the product-; on the other hand, the fact that it is necessary to reduce to the minimum the negative effects on the *librecambio of #all relative political measure to the public health, to the protection of the environment or to the social protection.
But the Council, afterwards, opened the box of #Pandora introducing two purportedly technical amendments: #one, to the article 3, in the that establishes a species of legislation delegated, with a continuous reference to the Regulation of the Economic Commission for *Europa of the Nations Joined; and #another, to the article 6, expanding the term of entrance in vigour of the directive because of the need of a time of adaptation of the industry.
The Commission #can accept the spirit, on condition that they introduce  modifications in #some cases to the text of the relative amendments to the complementary measures, the participation of the local communities in the reconstruction, the coordination with organisations no governmental, the query to the Parliament before the Agency extend his activities to other zones of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and, of course, to the budgetary transparency.
The Parliament approves the legislative resolution- Report *A5-00371999 of the Mrs. *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Repercussions of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course in the field of the juridical subjects and the inner market *SEC1999 581 - *C4-02191999
Although the decisions on the possibility by part of *Turquía to receive  to the programs in the frame of the current proposals do not allow an immediate effective participation of this country, will allow to the European Union send a positive signal to the #turkish civil society and express once again his will to develop the sectorial cooperation with *Turquía.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00401999 of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the common position of the Council 561721999 - *C5-00371999 - *19980272COD with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the information on the consumption of fuel facilitated to the consumer when commercialising vehicles of new tourism Speaker: Mr. *Sterckx.
*Yo Am absolutely convinced that it was an error -and want to signal it by a time- that the ancient European Commission did not continue, *cuando initiated  the previous legislative period, the work on a right of obligations #european, that already had initiated the Mr. *Lando and his commission, although this Assembly, that the Parliament, already had put to disposal the corresponding resources.
It did not has to be it to scale #european neither, obviously, neither to scale national, because *cuando exists the social dialogue - that in reality consists in the dialogue among the great unions of workers, often of the most traditional sectors of the economy, and the big company - with frequency are dialogues, cooperations, *concertaciones that have like result exclude to the one who today remains to the *margen of the economic systems Europeans, is to say, the unemployed, the immigrants, the convicts to remain  out of the system of the privileged, the that they find  out of the system of work guaranteed.
Gentleman President, in his proposal on the guidelines for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000, the Commission splits of a consideration of bottom: the progresses made by the process of employment, after the launching taken in the extraordinary Summit, are considerable; it signals data - a million #eight hundred one thousand places of work created in *Europa - and confirms, therefore, the structure based in four *pilares and the fundamental character of the guidelines.
We do not share the document on the guidelines for the politics of employment, since it inspires  in the ideas and the principles of the economic liberalism; without embargo, the European Parliament proposes #some indications to improve the equality of opportunities among men and women in matter of employment, the constant research of the dialogue among the social speakers and the necessary query and information of the workers by part of the companies.
But I believe that, for a so difficult directive - and the Parliament knows perfectly that it is difficult - have to take into account the reality of each country, the data of the social dialogue and the postures of the social speakers, the distinct nuances, in #all the points that have mentioned previously, and afterwards take a surgical combination, find a very fragile balance to have the greater possible hit.
It do not fits the lower doubt that in this important matter of the right of family, the extensive zone of absence of resultant right of the loss of efficiency of the judicial decisions in front of the borders has affected juridical and morally to thousands of citizens and has prejudiced to the social and psychological stability of the families, in particular his more fragile links that are the women and the boys.
The improvement of the relations among #Grecia and *Turquía, no longer like merit of the earthquakes, but like a fact aside, and the change of attitude that notes  in *Turquía with regard to the juridical and constitutional reform, in relation with the human rights and regarding the posture in front of the *kurdos are #worthy advances of applause, as also they are it the commitments and the recognition of the reality that give off of the letter that the Mr. *Bülent *Ecevit directed to the #german Chancellor, Mr. #Gerhard *Schröder, in May of the present year.
This proposal of resolution constitutes a clear signal to the international community that, in spite of that the #news on *Timor have disappeared of the main #european newspapers or have left to be the first #news of the most important televisions in *Europa, the attention of the international community and of the European Union on this problem has to continue.
There #be not doubt that the seventeen years that *Mumia *Abu-#Jamal finishes to happen rotting in the runners of the death, after a parody of process, are related with the fact that it is #black, with his fight against of the institutional racism, with the freedom of opinion that has practised this journalist, when having the value to report the corruption that reigns in the rows of the police of *Filadelfia.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00501999 of the Mr. Newton *Dunn in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects on the initiative of the Federal Republic of *Alemania for the adoption of a decision of the Council 83571999 - *C5-00111999 - *19990804SNS relative to the improvement of the exchange of information to combat the documents of trip false.
The fact that the #german Government have procured to avert the parliamentary examination posing this question in the field of the *tercer *pilar and the fact that the #finnish Presidency have not come at least to answer to our questions, was in the parliamentary commission, was in session *plenaria, regret to say that it is a stain for the reputation of the Finns, that up to now had an excellent reputation of opening and democracy.
In the time that remains until *Helsinki, is fundamental that analyse also the state of Right, the situation of the human rights, the respect to the minorities, the protection and the recognition of his cultural identity and the support to the measures directed to abolish the capital pity, that is #one of the amendments to the Report *Morillon presented in our commission this week.
The proposal of the Commission do not tackles specifically the problems of the pollution of the air acclimatise in the countries candidates, and had account of the imminent enlargement, consider little responsible that the Parliament do not receive any relative information to the levels of pollution in countries like *Polonia and the Czech Republic, #as well as on the #likely cost and the calendar that will be necessary to achieve that these countries adjust  to the new norms.
Gentleman President, when hailing the Report of the Court of Accounts, so useful, and that this Assembly has to support because like this we support to *Europa, #can not avert *referirme to the unrest that produces the that again they have been #some media the that have advanced partial versions and interested of the report, taken that apart from producing, gentleman *Karlsson, unnecessary damages to citizens, civil servants and institutions, gives the impression of that the Court of Accounts is a political organ that it has to *rendir accounts to the constituents through the public opinion.
And *yo believe that really this Parliament, with an action a bit more audacious of the Commission, a bit more ambitious and also -why not to say it- a bit more engaged with the process of reform of the institutions, #can achieve that the *desencuentros that have produced  in the past transform  in harmony in the future and that we #can #all promote this project of reform of the European Union, knowing, as we know, that, #if they do not take  in consideration and leave  to the *margen the worries of our citizens, these reforms will not be able to  concretise and will not be able to  culminate with hit.
Only to confirm to the Mrs. *Riis-*Jørgensen, #whose continuous and deep interest by the relative questions to the state help is very known and appreciated by the Commission, that the investigation goes to continue, that the effective applicability of the relative disposals to the #SME is #one of our worries and that in the analysis of #all the investigations on state help have  very present his effects in the trade among the States members.
Without embargo, also want to manifest with #the same clarity, so that it do not remain place to doubts, that the corresponding statements of the institutions, also on the subject of the review limited of the financial perspectives, that expect to receive of the Commission from the month of April, and the consequent answers of the Council, represent an operation of change, as #if it treated  of an office of change of currencies, for saying it like this. And the one who do not credits the change, loses his credit.
I go to mention #some of the actions assumed by the Commission, to stress that I am convinced that there #be a big field for a still greater activation so much of the Commission as of the states members and that, of course, requires  a specific politics for the treatment of these subjects, so much in the frame of the preparation of the meeting of follow-up of the Conference of *Beijing, as, later, in the frame of the *quinto plan of action for the woman.
On the base of the restructuring of the collaboration among the EU and *Centroamérica in the frame of the Congress of Saint #José in #Florencia in 1996, and of the documents of strategy elaborated in 1999 for the collaboration among the EU and *Nicaragua, have to indicate that, in the collaboration for the development with *Nicaragua in particular, the European Union concentrates  *primordialmente in the strengthening of the State of Right and the promotion of a just social politics.
It is true, of course have arisen some gigantic problems in *Bélgica and of course the European Commission, with reason, has said that in the #belgian situation have committed  some grave errors; but the colleagues Deputies, that to these heights know at least *algo of the file, know that the #belgian Government has taken some very drastic measures and that now #can give guarantees to #all the consumers of #all the #european Union.
With regard to the subjects that the President designated has posed on the reform, that the Commissioner *Kinnock will present the next month of February with the owed query, the program of politics of the next month of January, the imperative moral and politician to confront the challenge of the enlargement and the preparation of the Conference *Intergubernamental, promise that my Group will assume a positive and constructive commitment with the Commission in this sense.
As frankly I believe that in the attempt of #some in moving his domestic debates to the community institutions; in #some governments that play with the #european charges to satisfy requirements of pacts in his countries, and also in #some parties in the opposition that want to elevate to other instances it that do not achieve home, like the of the Mr. Baron, in *España, to the one who *le have commanded to prolong the internal electoral debate attacking -and *él knows it- of unfair and disloyal way to the vice-president proposed of the European Commission.
Tomorrow, a group of deputies of diverse political groups will initiate the works to create a *intergrupo that work in this sense, with the intention to create a spirit of cooperation with the Commission and with the Institutions of the Union in the sense that the collective rights and his recognition are a prolongation of the recognition of the individual rights.
Product of the negotiations among governments, his paper is the to contribute to create the most favourable conditions for the multinationals in his permanent efforts for increasing his benefits to coast of his own employees, the most recent example is the of *Michelin, and besides, in damage of the majority of the population of the European Union and of the poorest villages.
Since tomorrow we will not be able to vote in favour of determined Commissioners and place that #can not take state with my individual vote in this Assembly that my colleague Mr. *Patten #would be an excellent Commissioner of External Subjects, simply do not have more option that vote against of this Commission in his group to send the message to the Mr. *Prodi and to his colleagues that #if they go out chosen, will have to answer in front of this Parliament, accept that the things #can not follow as up to now and that we have to change of habits #if we want *infundir to the population of *Europa the confidence that have to have in this Parliament and his institutions.
As they explain the workers of help humanitarian of the international community, the employees of Cross #Red International and of other organisations of rights human were forced to abandon the zone, with the end to be able to commit the crimes without the presence of witnesses foreign.
The Council also has expressed his worry by the fact that, in addition to the #serbian population, other ethnic groups no *albanos have seen  forced to abandon *Kosovo; in this sense, the Council has remembered that in virtue of the resolution 1244 of the Council of Security of the UN, #all the refugees and the displaced have right to return to his zones of origin.
It #can, then, be acceptable that, after the competent organ of the European Union considered timely to raise the prohibition, determined States, without presenting neither take public a clear justification from the point of sight of the *inocuidad of the foods, keep the relative prohibition to the meat of bovine? This decision, adopted by the #french Government the past week, constitutes another hit particularly last for the *criadores of bovine livestock of *Escocia, #whose herds are fed predominantly with grass and that, first of all, did not have problem of *EEB.
Without embargo, as it has affirmed  here, the subject did not remains resolved with this program, but that the increase of the sustainable use of the sources of energy renewable demands still #a lot of study, pilot projects, the exchange of results in the investigation, the harmonisation of the legislation, the review of the attitudes, campaigns of information #as well as private and public investments, that will amortise  only in the future.
It is a modern agreement that adjusts  to the needs of our times. It loans special attention to the liberalisation of the rates, to the creation of a zone of free trade, to the commitments in the field of the development and of the economic cooperation, to the commitments in the terrain of the science and the technology and to the relative commitments to the political dialogue.
Subject: Measures of the Commission to restrict the transfer of armament and promote the, disarmament Taking into account the *primer annual report that will publish  *próximamente on the #european code of relative behaviour to the transfer of armament for 1998, #can indicate the responsible commissioner for the external relations #if it #would support an enlargement of the competitions of the Commission to include the subjects referents to the trade of arms in the next Conference *Intergubernamental?
In consequence, to my understand, it is necessary to ask to the President of the Commission, to the Council and to #all *nosotros that keep  and respect #all the agreements with the #turkish State, and that keep  besides a punctual action and it more specific possible of the competent organs of the Community, oriented to follow attentively that the process of democratisation and the peaceful solution to the divergences with the other States carry  advance specifically and no only to hit of statements of the #turkish State.
We happen to other three subjects: the protection of the environment, the health of the consumers and the audiovisual sector, that, further of the existent tensions among technical progress and cultural traditions, reflect shots of civilisation that *singularizan to *Europa: the requirement of quality -for example, in the field of the feeding-, the cultural identity in an open world, the preference by it no *vendible in some number of activities.
Subject: free Sales of taxes #Can the Council inform of his strategy to help to the airports, ports, aerial lines and companies of maritime transport of *pasajeros of *Irlanda to surpass the loss of income that results of the suppression of the free sales of taxes? How it foresees the Council protect to the consumers against the *encarecimiento of the notes, boost and protect the employment and support the development of infrastructures essential, *cuando all *eso took  before thanks to the free sales of taxes?
I have said another angular stone , because from the year happened this Parliament has to observe the most rigorous disposals of the that apply  to almost #all the other #european parliaments by it that refers  to the statement of the financial interests of his deputies and has already in the Regulation #one of the groups of disposals more rigorous that apply  to the behaviour of groups of interest in the frame of the institution.
Gentleman President, with rhythms of development underneath of the 2%, with a new promotion of the interests, with deflation and with a rigorous application of the pact of stability, intensifies  the pressure to the rights of security social and to the social rights of the workers, and the immediate result is the impairment of the conditions of life and of the labour conditions of the workers.
Although it do not fit doubt that the transparency has increased and, for example, the sessions of information after the meetings of the Council of Government have represented a clear improvement in the methods of work, the goal has to be the continuation of the increase of the opening, #as well as that the operation of the Bank consolidate  and was possible to leave backwards the problems of the initial stage.
Regarding the transparency, to the *cual define like the *ofrecimiento to the public or to the Parliament of the maximum possible information on the evolution of the economy, on the monetary evolution, on the result of the deliberations of the Council of Government, create -and like this *me manifested in my introductory intervention-, that the Central Bank European #can watch directly to the eyes of any central bank of the world.
In #a lot of States members - the history of these years *nos remembers it - exist cases of restructuring: the history, as I finish to say, is full of cases of restructurings, *deslocalizaciones, closings of companies - the Mr. *Wurtz has referred  to #some of *ellos - that no only reduce the employment, but that put in danger the economic and social cohesion of the zones affected, create a climate of insecurity social among the workers and a climate that do not favours at all the development and the growth.
Even I believe that have #a lot of interest, in the field of the legislative and institutional interventions, the proposals on the transfer of the taxation, of the territory of the labour cost, of the taxation of the workers, to the territory of the environment. And already there #be a *primer positive breath of the directives on the employment, in this direction.
Regarding the nuclear arms, exist two essential documents. By a part is the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms, in the that the countries with this type of armament have forced  to *desactivar his nuclear arms to change that other countries no the manufacture and, by #another, the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs, that is extraordinarily important since the proofs are to develop the nuclear armament.
Gentleman President, to the time that *subscribo the words of the colleagues that *me have preceded, wanted to express, in name of the Group *Europa of the Nations, the enormous joy that, in a many times motivated world by a hierarchy of interests and no by a hierarchy of values, this Parliament recognise to a valuable man that struggled by a value, the of the freedom of his village, and *le concede the prize *Sajarov.
Nevertheless, in my quality of Austrian, have to manifest, second, that this dialogue among the social speakers, among the political institutions, among the fiscal politics and the political mandators, comes  developing and practising under an analogous form from takes years in my country, *Austria, and has contributed of appreciable way to that *Austria #can present now like a country with a high level of employment and some figures of unemployment inferior to the of other countries.
In a moment in that the economic recovery #would allow at the same time a reduction of the public deficit and a politics of support to the growth, an effective coordination of the budgetary politics centred *prioritariamente in the investments *infraestructurales, the investigation, the education and the training #can have an effect of reflation economic durable.
In these proposals demands  to the States members that force  to reach a balance among men and women in places of direction, to appoint to #the same number of men and women in the committees and groups of work in the EU, to improve the legislation of the labour market so that #this reflect the problems and needs of the women and to form to the persons that design the national guidelines of politics of employment so that they integrate more effectively criteria of equality of opportunities in his work and, finally, to that in the countries members establish  goals *mensurables of annual character.
It do not has felt that we have to negotiate with the European Commission, after #all the events of the last months, a new code of behaviour that, among other things, insist in that, *cuando there are subjects of importance, the Commission has to come to say to this Assembly #which are these subjects first, and afterwards has to initiate a procedure, like the annual report of the Court of Accounts, and say: there #be had a leak, is unpleasant, but follow with the subject as #if #nothing had happened.
Already it has remembered  in other interventions that, takes #some years, the European Parliament had promoted pilot projects in support of the no governmental organisations and of the local authorities that, from takes time, confront  with actions of fight against the violence to the women and the boys: a phenomenon, #this of the violence to the women and the boys, by misfortune, no only very spread, but that goes in increase and that  self-evident under forms increasingly sophisticated and, therefore, more difficult to combat.
Insist in the current logic of the cost, in the that stands out the corresponding to the Common Agricultural Politics, that, in addition to putting in *entredicho any goal of equity recognised like principle in the Treaties, of politics only has the denomination, insist in the system of income in vigour, fruit of diverse and contradictory interests among yes, results *indefectiblemente *inconciliable with the wish of deepening of the project of enlargement of the geographic space.
It suffice to think in the Indian, #whose legislation do not foresees right of copyright on the medicines or the foods, to weigh that in the Indian produce  and of the Indian proceed grasses that serve to the multinationals and to *nosotros for our illnesses; or to the *Sudáfrica of *Mandela that like reprisal to his attempt to convert in more accessible the treatment for the patients of AIDS, has seen  impose by the World-wide Organisation of Trade the withdrawal of the cheapest medicines.
Only it wanted to highlight a look that #can consider  that it constitutes the foundation of our conjoint resolution on *Chechenia: the suffering of the civil population, the hundreds of victims mortal, the 200.000 refugees and the situation in the that find  with the arrival of the winter, the disproportionate reaction of the #russian Government and the bombardment *indiscriminado of the civil population.
To risk that *nos *remuerda the consciousness, #would wish to remember the example of the banana: the multinationals Of the Mount, *Dole and *Chiquita, that with the support of the States Joined commercialise in the #european market the pertinent bananas of the slavery, produced, besides, in some conditions of security alimentary more that doubtful, have reached *hacernos pin the knee; it treats  of a file in the that #be to capitulate without conditions, leaving that they break hundreds of thousands of producers no only of the countries *ACP, but also the community producers, that are the of #Guadalupe and *Martinica!
The Commission signals repeatedly in his report of situation on the progresses made in the adaptation to the *acervo community that, in numerous looks, the countries candidates, so much the of the group of head like the of the second group, still advance of way very *vacilante in the transposition and adaptation to the *acervo community; for example, in relation with the social subject, but also regarding the subject of the environment and the energy and even in the subject of the human rights and the daily democracy.
In front of an extraordinary event and the unilateral initiatives of peace like the decision of the PKK to abandon the fight armed and suspend the hostilities, in front of the decision of numerous leaders of the PKK to deliver  to the #turkish authorities to reiterate his option to negotiate the peace, the #turkish Government has given negative and pejorative answers.
I want to remember the attentive attitude of our speaker and his *receptividad in front of the demand to the Commission of new complementary information, reason of the delay of the vote in the Plenary of his report until so much the Commission did not satisfy his request referred to the last scientific reports that endorsed the coverage of the geographic area delimited in the #Douglas *Bank *Box and the redesign of the conditions and his extension.
I do not propose to dismiss definitively the candidature of *Turquía to the European Union. But it is necessary, previously, demand to *Turquía firm and definite commitments, and check that they fulfil : the recognition of the rights of the village *kurdo, the abolition of the pity of death and a new trial for *Ocalan, the release of *Leyla *Zana and of #all the political prisoners, the application of the resolutions of the Nations Joined for the solution of the #cypriot problem.
So that it do not give  here a mistaken impression this morning in relation with the process of peace and the international bottom for *Irlanda, want, like deputy to the Parliament by the border counties, take state here -and create to talk in name of the village of *Irlanda- that appreciate fully the important, positive and practical paper that the European Parliament and the #european institutions have exerted in the process of peace and believe that say it contrary do not reflects the opinion of the #irish village.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00861999, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, concerning the common position 1424711999 - *C5-00271999 - *19970264COD adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the safe of civil responsibility derived of the circulation of vehicles cars and by the that amend  the Directives *73239CEE and *88357CEE *Cuarta Managerial on the safe of vehicles cars Speaker: Mr. *Rothley
Gentleman President, the past Monday try, from the Socialist Group, include in the agenda of this Plenary a proposal of resolution that highlighted the *50º anniversary of the Agreements of Gin, put of self-evident the commitment of the European Parliament with the principles of the humanitarian international Right and expressed our support to the International Committee of the #Red Cross.
Report *A5-01011999 of the Mr. *Papayannakis, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council that modifies the Regulation of the Council *CE *nº 82097 by the that it establishes  a system of identification and register of the animals of the bovine and relative species to the labeling of the meat of *vacuno and of the products to base of meat of *vacuno *COM1999 487 - *C5-02411999 - *19990205COD
Although the #turkish Prime minister have declared the next day of the Summit that the belonging to the European Union was for *Turquía, quote: a right of birth -it that gives, by it other, an idea of the modesty with the *cual is decided to open the door of the European Union-, is evident for #all the observers that conserve the free mind that his entrance #would change deeply the nature of the Union.
#A lot of States members of the European Union have to answer to #a lot of questions by it that refers  to his own support in the past to the #indonesian authorities *cuando #this *oprimía to the village of *Timor Oriental, and by the fact that these countries and his companies of manufacture of armament have obtained enormous benefits to coast of innocent lives, of the welfare and of the right of the persons to live freely, without being subjected to tightness #any neither to rapes of the human rights.
*Me States, like speaker of the recent managerial on the filling of earth, that it that is occurring is that the European Commission is proposing norms on the base that they go to be approved and adequately applied in the States members whereas, to #the same time, #the same general direction of the European Union knows perfectly that in #a lot of areas of the politics do not exist able inspections of *averiguar #if these norms are applied in #some States members of the European Union.
And in front of this dangerous panorama no only do not remain indifferent, no only condemn it, and vote against of the new Commission, but that besides call to the workers and to the villages of *Europa to carry advance his fights, to raise a wall against the disastrous plans that  *ciernen on his future, the call to *darle the turn to the current situation, by #one *Europa different, by a *Europa of the villages, of the peace and the solidarity, of the mutually beneficial collaboration.
Thus I believe that our more urgent task consists in fulfilling the previous conditions to the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice. In concrete, have to begin for elaborating a Letter of rights fundamental #european place that do not treats  only to centralise the state and police power, but that also is necessary *europeizar the rights of the citizens.
I have taken it so much more easily what that the procedure chosen for said auditions has allowed to remember the commitment contracted by the Commission to present, before the end of the year 1999, a group of proposals allocated to give at last concrete content to the section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, that consecrates the specificity of the regions *ultraperiféricas and *instituye in *pro of *ellas the right to particular disposals, derogatory, for *permitirles confront his structural difficulties.
On the other hand, for treating  of the *PTU associated to the European Union, the Commissioner *Nielson has recognised the need to present with the greater shortness a group of proposals directed to give to these countries a statute adapted to his current situation with seen to the next agreement of association, with the consequence in particular of the renewal of the financial instrument assigned to his development.
It treats  of a political decision that the parliamentary commission and the Commission of Control Budgetary have to adopt, and the message that, therefore, it is necessary to transmit to the Mrs. *Schreyer -#if it do not comes from of *usted, Mr. Commissioner, that come from, at least, of the services of the Commission- is that we want to celebrate early a meeting with the Mrs. *Schreyer to argue about the content of a *PRS5 that it will have to present to the Parliament it before possible and, it that it is even more important, include the additional personnel for *OLAF.
This Agreement went in in vigour on 24 October 1996 and his goal is to reach and keep a high level of nuclear security to scale world-wide, developing national measures and tightening the international cooperation, #as well as cater to the nuclear head offices of effective protections in front of possible radioactive leakages so that the individuals, the society and the environment find  to save of the harmful effects of the pertinent ionic radiations of these head offices.
Support it that has said before the Mr. *Swoboda, but in front of the situation that have at present in *Turquía, is to say, in front of the disposal to take advantage of the relations with the #european speakers, in the proposal of resolution of today #would have to talk of a mood much more concretise on the helps to *Turquía and show to our #turkish friends that are here *cuando need our help and *transmitirles the feeling of that they are not seen by *nosotros of a general mood like enemies, it that before the earthquake with frequency was like this.
The main purpose is to give a break to the budget *rectificativo and supplementary *nº 499, approved the past 16 September, proposing, in accordance with the proposal formulated by the Commission in this moment, fund greater credits; to know: for *PHARE 98 millions of euros, for *TACIS 68 millions of euros, for the humanitarian helps to *Turquía 15 millions of euros, for *Kosovo 21 millions of euros, for the cooperation with *Sudáfrica 20 millions of euros, for the environment and the tropical forests 10 millions of euros.
#If I have not understood badly, the next week will be *usted available also to examine the relative questions to the enlargement, but, like general principle, it that has initiated *usted today here is important and #would appreciate  the opportunity to continue this dialogue among our two institutions by means of appropriate mechanisms and formalised, already take part *usted personally or by mediation of other members of the School of Commissioners, as it proceed, in other weeks of celebration of partial periods of sessions, in function of the agenda.
In equality of conditions, #if it wants to, #can situate it in the first place, without embargo, in my opinion, the problem of the human resources is dramatically important for our continent and, #if no *le put remedy with urgency by means of a very wide program that take part in this sector, believe that not even the reduction of the taxes, in spite of having a content and to offer a very strong contribution, will suffice to achieve the development of the #european industry.
The *segunda question, that is related with the main object of my question, is #if it has not thought the Commission that, of #the same way that there #be a directive, the directive *SEVESO, that foresees the protection of the workers and of the citizens, in the zones of the facilities, in front of accidents in industrial companies, it #would be necessary to take #some measures for the protection, of the industrial companies especially, in front of natural catastrophes like the seisms.
It That then *sucedería is that the European Union  *jactaría to having reduced his pollution, to having reduced his broadcasts, but to the price of, in the first place, the loss of places of #european work, and second, the world #would not have reduced his levels of pollution in it more minimum; simply it #would have exported  the pollution.
This plan proposes also measures oriented to diverse sectors of consumption and allocated to intensify the knowledges in matter of energy and the practice in spheres like the acquisition of appliances, the utilisation of energy in the home, the facilities of the buildings, the systems of heating, the energetic management in the industry, the sector of the services and the public sector.
It wanted to add that, along the debate celebrated on 14 October in the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, and to the sight of the worry shown in particular by the article 2, #all the members of the commission agree an amendment that now appears like last paragraph of the article 2 and that prays it following: Said article will apply  without damage of the requirements of confidentiality established in the law, or was, in the Treaties, or established in the Regulation of the European Parliament .
It is, for the European Union, the occasion to reaffirm his moral duty that consists in tending the hand to the world in development; the occasion to show until how point want to struggle against the poverty, against the injustice, against the discriminations of #all type, against the fault of democracy, against the attacks to the human rights and against the freedom.
In front of this Central Bank or to this saint Bank - do not know exactly how describe it -, of the *cual his vice-president, the Mr. *Noyer, *nos explained recently of a form affected, but in English, until how point #this felt  manager of the long term *cuando the governments yielded to the whims of the short term since they were subjected to the uncertainties of the universal suffrage, front, therefore, to any power of this Bank, the excellent report of the Mr. *Huhne demands more transparency, without *atreverse on the other hand to *reclamarle it that it #can happen by exhibition, is to say, go out of the anonymity of the decisions.
The #european citizens, gentleman President, interest  and concern  mainly by the content of the politics of the Central Bank European, of the European Union and of the States members; a politics that gives absolute priority to the called monetary stability and to the interests of the big financial capital, and the price that have to pay is a dramatic reduction of the employment and the total destruction of the called social model European.
The monetary orientations of the #ECB, that base  in the fulfillment of the Pact of Stability and of his criteria of convergence nominal and prevail the stability of prices, finish being determinants for the national and #european politics in the most diverse economic and social spheres, included the budgetary perspectives of the European Union and of the States members.
As probably it expected the Parliament, the summit was dominated inevitably by the direct conversations on *Chechenia, as it has indicated the Presidency, in the that the European Union *presionó by a reduction of the climbing, by the turn to the political dialogue, by a proportional utilisation of the strength to cut across the terrorism and by that find  a solution to the humanitarian crisis.
In this sense, want to manifest my coincidence with the Mr. *Hatzidakis and with *algún another orator and regret that the European Committee of Normalisation have not reached still an agreement that #would allow to the States members legislate according to it that it has to be the definite rule; and not to see *abocados, #if it is that today and along the next weeks are not able to modify the current Managerial, to legislate to go back to change shortly time the legislation, with #all the problems that *ello #would involve.
In the case of *Marruecos and of this agreement of fishing, neither is possible to go back to ignore the rights of the village *saharaui, beginning by his right to the self-determination, his right to constitute an independent State, #if it opts thus, and to protect the natural wealths of his territory, already treat  of the *yacimientos of phosphate or, in particular, of the resources of his maritime seaboard, that find  loomed by this agreement.
The question of the alimentary security has converted  in a look of crucial importance in our societies, #would say even a requirement of our *conciudadanos Thus, think that it is precise to proceed to scientific examinations more exhaustive in the breast of the Scientific Committee taking into account #all the most recent data in wait of the proofs of diagnostic precocious that #can apply to the alive animals and reinforcing the controls to #all the levels.
In the first place, #that, like the social speakers or the Central Bank, that have a direct influence in the factors of the equation #such as the training of the wages or the level of the types of interest and afterwards, second, in a particular group, the European Commission and the advisers of the Commission with seen, for example, to the combination of politics.
The recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00411999 of the Mrs. *Smet, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive *93104CE of the relative Council to determined looks of the ordination of the time of work, to include the sectors and activities excluded of said Managerial 864211999 - *C5-00361999 - 19980318 *COD.
And among the socialist amendments, there #be #one, that put of relief the Mrs. *Wallis, that signals the special position of the regions *ultraperiféricas, that find  totally separated of the community territory, very #move# away of *él and that, therefore, in the application of the community Right, of compliance with the new article 299.2 of the Treaty, #can not be regulated by #the same norms that apply  to the community inner market in the continental field.
In effect, like European Union and like States members, #would have to have the value to ask and favour the entrance of *cientos of thousands of persons that, today, only by the fact to come of out of the European Union #can cover the works with a level of innovation higher because it is not only the training of the hand of drama, of the strength of work at present existent inside the European Union that it #can take it.
. IN Gentleman President, the Commission has the pleasure to take part in it that it is the final step for the adoption of the Program *Daphne 2000-2003, a program of action community, of four years of length, based in the experience of the initiative *Daphne, *cuando the European Parliament in 1997, for the first time, included budgetary games to combat the violence against the boys, the teenagers and the women.
The Commission has employed in the last years credits to ensure the security of service of the nuclear head offices on the that today talk here while no  *desconecten, #if well #such measures centre  in improving the culture of security in these countries, in the creation of authorities supervisory independent or in the training of persons that #can exert #such supervision.
Known is that in the European Union keeps  in levels elevated the violence against the boys, the teenagers and the women, it that constitutes a rape of his right to the life, the security, the freedom, the dignity and the physical and emotional integrity, #as well as a grave threat for the physical and mental health of the victims of the violence.
The central goals in the case of *Afganistán are, #among others, the achievement of a stable peace, the promotion of the internal dialogue in *Afganistán backing, in particular, the fundamental paper of the Nations Joined, the advance of the stabilisation and of the development of *Afganistán by means of the peace and the intensification of the fight against the illegal drugs and the terrorism.
But, to answer to the question, #would signal that in *Yugoslavia, taking into account, for example, the measures of the police and his aggressive behaviour to the demonstrations, #as well as the attitude of the diet of *Milosevic to the press and to the freedom of information, the current circumstances are #such, that, by the moment, do not give  the necessary conditions to organise some free democratic elections in *Yugoslavia.
Without embargo, this report collects fundamental principles that *nos seem essential, like the principle of caution, the norms on the methods and the procedures of production; the report takes upsetting, in particular, in the labeling of the foods, to guarantee the application of the alimentary security, and in the need to adopt a more favourable position to the countries in roads of development.
This building *antipopular, *antidemocrático and authoritarian, built to serve to the big capital, will be demolished by the own villages, by means of the resistance, the intervention, the change of the correlation of strengths. To build the *Europa of the peace and the cooperation, of the friendship and the equality among the villages, of the true Democracy and of the Freedom, of the economic prosperity in benefit of the workers.
It is important that in this legislative diary collect  the special treatments that establishes the section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty *CE for the #french departments of *Ultramar, the *Azores, *Madeira and the Canarian islands, because, of not being like this, #would get to a position and to a situation in the *cual these #european regions, vital for each #one of our States and for the European Union, #would find  in absolute disadvantage regarding the group of the European Union.
Curiously, this disarmament *arancelario of the *APIM has not produced the effect wished in the sensitive industries of Canarians, by it that the #spanish authorities, the #canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested to the community authorities the modification of the Regulation *nº 191191 so as to paralyse the disarmament of the *APIM until June of the year 2000, subject that the European Commission has understood.
And finally, *permítanme take a reference to an absolutely key subject for *nosotros: the growth, the stability and the employment, subject in the that the line initiated in *Luxemburgo, followed in *Cardiff, Colony and *Helsinki, has to concretise in the next summit of face to the #portuguese Presidency because we understand that, to have a prosperous future in the Union, have to be able to be more competitive and generate more economic growth, but putting the emphasis in the employment and in the social cohesion, that is and has to be #ours first priority.
*Yo Believe that #all agree in that the citizens and citizen of *Europa have right to breathe a healthier air, and in the last publication of the European Agency of Environment signals  that in the majority of the cities reigns a pollution of the air that results hurtful for the health and that in the 115 #european cities of greater size almost 40 millions of persons are subjected to an upper level to the established in the guidelines for the quality of the air of the WHO, regarding a *contaminante at least.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A500641999 of the Mrs. *González *Álvarez, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the common position adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  a plan of follow-up of specific broadcasts averages of dioxide of carbon of the new tourisms *COM1998 348  *C500411999  *19980202COD.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00441999 of the Mr. *Sjöstedt, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the proposal of decision of the Council on the approval, in name of the Community, of the amendments to the Annexes of the Agreement on the protection of the half marine of the zone of the sea *Báltico Agreement of *Helsinki *COM1999 128 - *C4-02181999 - *19990077CNS.
To reflect in the text of the proposal a suitable treatment of this no resolved problem, in the breast of the Council is  *consensuando the incorporation of a new point 7 in the that they collect  the external characteristics that they have to gather, for his commercialisation in the #mediterranean areas of the Community, the better forest species adapted to his difficult conditions of floor and climate.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, #all agree in that the common coin constitutes the previous condition so that the inner market work, in that a stable coin constitutes also a contribution to the social and economic security of *Europa and in that, by this reason, the euro is also, in definite, a successful history as it has had like consequence the reduction of the deficit in our States members and a descent of the inflation.
Although in this subject the commitment in our commission was especially arduous, the facts seem *darnos the reason since, after the political agreement reached in the Council of ministers last, so much the loins of tuna like the herring go out of the system of suspensions *arancelarias, in addition to another series of corrections that affect to other products comprised in the annex *V.
In it *concerniente to the organisations of producers, is truth that it is necessary *responsabilizarlas even more, #if it fits, so much regarding the organisation of the market as to the rational management of the resources; without embargo, #would be convenient -and in this sense underline the relevance of the amendment 67, presented by my political Group- that the States members #can concede complementary helps to the organisations of producers that boost measured of assessment of the species fished and of *adecuación of the offer to the demand through structural actions of the *IFOP.
Gentleman President, the Commissioner *Lamy and other orators have referred  to the meeting of *Seattle like a failure, but follow believing that #if the European Union and the States Joined, in particular, learn the lesson of these last weeks, the meeting of *Seattle #can happen to the history no like a failure, but like the moment in that the leaders of the world gave  account at last that they have to focus the international trade of a radically different way.
In general terms, treats  of an approach or, better said, of an intention *loable and in line with the Protocol of *Montreal that to #the same time, without embargo, do not takes into account #some facts. In the first place, the fact that the other countries signatories of the Protocol, among the *cuales are the States Joined, foresee terms longer for the cessation of the production of the *hidroclorofluorocarburos; second, that the *hidroclorofluorocarburos, to the sight of the current knowledges, represent the only true alternative, in the field of the *antiincendio, to the *halógenos, main enemies of the coat of ozone, #whose use is generalised in the countries in roads of development.
. Gentleman President, the Program *TACIS has devoted his best efforts to support to *Mongolia, *Rusia and the rest of the New Independent States in the realisation of reforms and in the political and administrative restructuring of his social and economic institutions to facilitate the construction of a democratic society that support  in an economy of market free.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation *A5-00791999 of the Mr. *Bodrato, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the celebration of the Agreement on the establishment of regulations technical world-wide applicable to the vehicles of tyres, and to the squads and pieces that #can mount or use in said vehicles Agree Parallel 101671999 - *COM1999 27 - *C5-00731999 - *19990011AVC.
To finalise wanted to reiterate my gratitude to #all the colleagues of the Commission of Environment, Public and Political Health of the Consumers for having given green light to the amendments presented by the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. I consider fundamental that the European Parliament talk today with an alone voice and issue a univocal signal regarding this crucial subject for the consumers.
We criticise the decision to develop the means of the European Union for the military management of crisis, in the field of a #european common politics reinforced in matter of security and defence, conceived in the development and the strengthening of the *pilar #european of the NATO, of #the same mood that refuse the militaristic vision of resource to the war for the resolution of conflicts international.
On our part, we do not see any better solution that the restoration of a new international order of the trade, that respect the sovereignty of the States, his rhythm and his modalities of development, that respect his traditions also, traditions that will not dissolve of a hit of wand magic because we will have imposed the elections, the human rights and it that call, too much *apresuradamente, democracy.
I believe that, in front of the seriousness of the subject, had been preferable to have a statement of the President of the Commission, with seen to the document that expect of the Mr. *Kinnock, on the institutional reform, expect to a report elaborated by the competent organ of this Assembly and pose, in this moment, the position of the Parliament on the future operation of the Commission.
Regarding the transparency -already have said it, gentleman President- our Group *le awards his full confidence, a confidence that, obviously, depends of the results that *usted and his Commission will reach, a confidence that depends of the demonstration of the force of these great moral qualities and professional of each #one of the Commissioners, on the *cuales go to watch with #all the means and in #all the forms, also in those better forms of transparency that *usted *nos has guaranteed.
And it do not treats  of simple general subjects that have to resolve in a future, but that urge on purpose to the Council to that in virtue of the last tendencies in the field of the flows of refugees and in matter of asylum introduce by means of decision of the Council, the vote by majority in these subjects in the term prescribed of five years, with the automatic consequence that foresees  in these cases, to know, the respect of the rights of *codecisión of the European Parliament.
#If well we underline the interesting movement initiated in the relations among this institution and the Parliament, #as well as our will to work in *pro of the hit of the administrative reform announced, expressed the *convencimiento that, to answer to the hopes *apremiantes of our *conciudadanos, #would have taken is missing to take the initiative of changes significant that affect no only to the operation of the Commission, but also to his own political orientations.
The proposals on the help in the police and judicial collaboration in the penal questions, #as well as the distinct proposals on the creation of the juridical field European, conceal the help and the back enlargement of the operative possibilities of the *Europol and of the national authorities putting in grave danger the fundamental democratic rights and the public freedoms.
But precisely these same feelings *solidarios to the #turkish village, are the that demand that this catastrophe of the earthquakes was not considered like #one *coartada and that do not unblock  the bottoms of finance #if the #turkish diet do not advances in the fulfillment of the conditions on the respect of the human rights, of *Chipre and of the question *kurda, of #such way that show that, anyway, has the intention to give determined steps.
In *tercer place, finally, it is necessary to add, in the scientific field, the need to examine in detail and complete the knowledges and scientific methods that we have for the production of foods and *piensos safe; likewise, the methods of detection and the maximum of the different substances that contaminate the foods, #as well as the *adecuación of the pertinent alimentary ingredients of different animal or vegetal waste or of the recycling, as, for example, of the recycling of oils.
It Same fits to say on the review of the financial perspectives that it is necessary also owing to the help to *Kosovo, of the repair of the damages of the earthquakes of *Turquía and the agreements of fishing of *Marruecos, and is not *desligada of the fact that in the category *IV there #be not in this moment sufficient money to make #all these projects that the Council and the Commission want to carry out with his proposals.
The evaluation put of relief that *SAVE is a valuable normative instrument to boost the energetic efficiency, but underlined that it was necessary a clear and coherent strategy for the experimental actions, that the diffusion of the results is the key for the hit on a long-term basis and that the efficiency on a long-term basis requires to improve the permanent supervision and the analysis of the repercussions.
Of course, it is precise that work together with other organisations and thus had special care in giving account of our work with the #Red Cross, with the World-wide Program of Foods, with the *ACNUR and with other organisations involved, for example, the WHO, precisely to achieve that it remained clear that #this is a humanitarian operation; without embargo, believe that it also is positive that the population and the #serbian political class see that the rest of the world also is prepared to help of this form.
The statute of candidate and the signals of opening are well, always that it have  the value to repeat first of all to *nosotros same that it will be difficult to receive to *Turquía in the European Union while the #turkish Government follow ignoring the resolutions of the Council of Security on the invasion of *Chipre, while I continued denying the existence of a minority *kurda talking *genéricamente of terrorists, and while *Öcalan do not remain free of the threat of the pity of death.
*Le #Would ask to the President in exercise of the Council -since it do not has data on the reduction of the populations of tuna- #if has news on the failure of the *desovación of the salmon during the last year in the river of *Tornio, among *Finlandia and *Suecia, and #if the President in exercise of the Council will call the attention of the responsible Commissioner of fishing on the fact that the fishing with networks of mesh to the derives #would have to be limited also in the *Báltico and no only in the zones mentioned of the #atlantic tuna.
The market of work, the initial training and the continuous training are key sectors for the active promotion of the woman, and the measures of accompaniment, as for example the attention of the dependent persons, are very important precisely in the case of the women and contribute to *facilitarles the access to the market of work.
Also we have problems with the other categories, as for example in the category 3, that includes the that have been traditionally the central points of our politics: the environmental politics, the programs of training of the youngsters, the investigation, the networks *transeuropeas, with his opportunities for the creation of employment and the improvement of our to scale world-wide competitiveness.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, wish first of all congratulate to the #finnish Presidency by the hit that has been *Tampere when opening a new stage in the development of the #european citizenship, attending to the always difficult balance among freedom and security, and *ello shows that no only are taking a Union based in freedoms for the commodities, the services and the capitals, but also to answer to the freedom of establishment and of trip of the citizens and the citizens.
This reform, that #all know, in it deeper of *nosotros, that is necessary, is not only and neither in the first place question of time, is in the first place a question of will political, of lucidity on our own current operation and his insufficiencies; it is question of value, of collective value, that will have or will not have, to concede this time the priority to the Union, to concede the priority to a vision on a long-term basis, that surpasses -know it perfectly, although it was difficult- the prudences and the immediate interests.
And #this because, in spite of the fine will of each #one and of #a lot of colleagues - to those who *les give the graces - this Institution has not found any solution to the situation of the no inscribed deputies, a situation that is intolerable from the point of sight administrative and financial and even more from the point of sight of the parliamentary prerogatives. In effect, do not have faculties neither of amendment neither of resolution.
Before beginning to expose the position of the relative Commission to the amendments approved by the Parliament on 16 September, *permítanme take upsetting in that the Commission has tried to examine the suggestions of the Parliament with #the same spirit with the that am sure that the presented the Parliament, to know, #which is the best way to make our collective effort European on the terrain in *Kosovo and in #all the region.
In some mood, the cynicism of the method *Michelin has had like consequence #one *decuplicación of the phenomenon of rejection that causes increasingly this modern capitalist strategy, the of *share-*holder *value, the creation of values for the #shareholders, that consists in subordinating it all, and in the first place these costs *insoportables, in his opinion, that represent the places of work, to the requirements *bulímicas of the financial shareholders of the company.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00271999 of the Mr. *Hatzidakis, in name of the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism, on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive *9649CE on the approximation of the legislations of the States relative members to the transport of commodities dangerous by railway *COM19990157 - *C5-00051999 - *19990087COD.
But helping of the best possible way to both parts: to *Angola, on the one hand, and to the States of the European Union and to the regions that fish, by #another, with the control of this Parliament and in accordance with the amendments that the Commission of Fishing has presented with regard to this important Agreement, that has, as it finishes to be reflected here, a remarkable political dimension, in addition to some economic and financial dimensions.
I believe that #if we do not tackle the look of the production of form integrated, is to say, from the moment in that they choose  the matters prevail of the car happening by the *manufactura of #the same, the process of production, the use and, finally, the recycled or final disposal of the car *cuando no longer uses it the buyer, do not go really to achieve take measures that are really significant in the field of the reduction of the gases of effect *invernadero.
I am totally in accordance with the observations of the Mr. *MacCormick on the situation of the artists, that it #would be necessary to extend to #all the field of the intellectual creation, that finds  with a deficit inside the European Community, especially in matter of external competitiveness, and am also in accordance with his observation on the need to guarantee the free circulation and the free exercise of the intellectual profession inside the European Community.
There #where the nuclear energy contributes to reach the goals of reduction of the broadcasts of CO2, increase simultaneously our environmental problems by the nuclear waste and *eso goes against of the goals of the communication of the here presented Commission, that pleads by a more effective integration of the environment in the energetic politics.
Without embargo also believe that it exists a contradiction that perhaps have to see in his whole with the fault of decision that exists in the energetic politics inside the European Union *cuando *usted sees to the dessert the security in the cases mentioned in the closing -in it that coincide with *usted-, but *cuando treats  of nuclear head offices *equiparables in the States of the *CEI, wants to guarantee said security by means of modernisations and the impulse of the measures of security by part of the European Union.
It thinks the European Commission keep the commitment purchased by the Commissioner Mr. *Brittan, in front of the Commission of Subjects External of the European Parliament, that of not to fulfil entirely the terms of the Agreement, the European Union #would go back to request the opening of a signpost in front of the instances of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade?
As it put  of self-evident in the historical meeting -is the adjective that, aptly, has used the High Representative- that has celebrated this week the Council of Subjects General to the that assisted the ministers of Defence, the States members believe that a greater cooperation in the field of the security and the defence in the European Union will contribute two main advantages.
In effect, of compliance with the article 18 of the Treaty of the European Union, the European Commission has to take part fully in #all the looks of the External Politics and of Common Security and our Group proposes  defend, therefore, in #all moment the interests of the Commission, because #this are also the interests of the European Union, and by #this go to collect also his collaboration in interest of *Europa, a collaboration that *yo believe that the personality of #both guarantees that it will be excellent.
And regarding the paper of the Parliament, believe that we have shown in these years our capacity of help and of accompaniment and understand that, from the point of sight of it that they #can and have to be the dimension and the development of the defence and the common security of the Union, #can exert an important paper in relation with the rest of the world; I believe that in this occasion have to offer our collaboration and #ours better attitude.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00561999 of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, on the common position of the Council 915011999 - *C5-01811999 - *19980192CODcon seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that approves  a program of action community Program *DAPHNE 2000-2003, on preventive measures allocated to combat the violence exerted on the boys, the teenagers and the women Speaker: Mrs. *Avilés *Perea
The second look *atañe to the agriculture for the *cual, together with a greater liberalisation of the market in favour of the countries in development, it is necessary to ask, apart from the maintenance of the community principles -the support to the environmental politics, the definition of an alimentary politics in defence of the consumer- the protection of the characteristics and of the agricultural products typically national
According to the article 18 of the conjoint Resolution of the Parliament and of the Council on the network of communications to #european level, the States members deliver regularly to the Commission his national programs and the programs that design to develop the network of communications to #european level, especially, the projects specified in the Resolution and that affect to the common interests.
Precisely the diffusion of the pity of death represents #one of the most intolerable rapes of the dignity and of the right to the life of each individual: a rape that regret deeply and to the that we want to face up remembering, for example, that #the same process of enlargement of the Union is showing  no only like a factor of peace and of security of the Continent, but also like a path so that the countries candidates surpass said barbarism.
It wanted to respect roughly my time of use of the word, but in the frame of this debate suits to remember that we do not have to take in consideration only the point of sight #nordic, neither the passion *desbordada of the *enamorados of the #austrian forests, but that go in in our zone, in the centre of the EU, and also in *Alemania, concede a big importance to the clauses of liberalisation, so as to that #all the approach follow being really feasible.
On #one of these products, for putting an example, the of the loins of tuna, said study is establishing levels of deficit of among 1.500 and 3.000 tonnes, is to say that, cheerfully and without data contrasted, the Commission was had to drown a community sector with thousands of places of work, #as well as his own systems of help to the development to the countries *SPG-Drugs and *ACP by a need of import real inferior to 3.000 tonnes that #can cover perfectly with the current system of contingents *arancelarios.
Also it foresees the Regulation that #if an elect deputy abandoned the Parliament before it approve  in the Plenary the present report, will examine  his vacancy and the provision of #the same, of compliance with the article 8 of our internal Regulation and in accordance with the applicable disposals of the Record of 20 September 1976, in a separate procedure, independent of this report and that will take place in the timely moment.
Since we consider to *Turquía like a fellow country, *nosotros wish that it achieve to build an authentic civil society, that achieve to concede a true identity to the *kurdos, as it splits ethnically differentiated of the population, obviously inside the #turkish state unit and in the frame of the #turkish nation, and entrust in that the military power Turkish, that is #allied of Occident -and #this is in reality it tragic-, also take into account the *proporcionalidad of the means in front of the problem *kurdo and, every time that they arise problems with the *kurdos, do not try *resolverlos by military means in place to resort to the dialogue.
The European Council of Colony decided that it drafted  a Letter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union before the European Council of December of 2000 and that the editorial ran to charge of an organ composed of 15 representatives of the Bosses of State or of Government, 16 deputies to the European Parliament, included His *Señoría, 30 deputies to the national parliaments and *yo, in representation of the President of the Commission.
Gentleman President, the budgetary discussion of this year has been so odd that, even among the speech of the general speaker, to the beginning of the debate, and my own intervention has *sucedido, by chronological order, it following: an informal meeting of the Commission of Budgets, a meeting of the budgetary Council and a meeting of the political groups.
Fifteen members are five less of the that has the Commission, but in a relatively small institution as it is the Court of Accounts, any new enlargement will suppose a marked increase of the weight of the cusp and a greater inertia, that already  self-evident very *nítidamente in the actuality in the excessive slowness of the necessary procedure until the Court of Accounts #make his report.
The plan no *carecía of this requirement and, therefore, focus this debate on the base that the plan of export in base to the date did not demand the establishment of said terms #would induce to deception, because it #would be unfair for the scientists that determined the necessary measures to guarantee that the export of meat of *vacuno #british did not encloses any danger, and also #would be unfair for the Commission in the approach that has adopted up to now.
I do not believe that they estimate  adequately neither that take  seriously in consideration, at least to judge by the debates that have kept  up to now -am new euro-deputy- the economic and social repercussions of the phenomenon of the illegal immigration, or, #if it wants , of the real immigration, even to *través of the legal procedure, by the parallel flow of illegal immigrants and the imminent pertinent flow of countries that will be community after the enlargement of the European Union.
The third question treats of my worry by these #round-up, because it do not believes *usted that because of the #round-up through other States members of a same linguistic territory is very easy *torpedear the only price of the books and that results little effective to protect the special value of the book like cultural object and the special meaning of the market of the book for the culture?
It That has reached  in one hundred years in the space *germanófono among *Austria, *Alemania and Swiss; it that has taken possible and guaranteed a big diversity; it that do not deletes in any case the competition, but that has by consequence ensure the to scale general supply by means of great and small bookshops in the cities and in the field, #can not abandon to the *desenfrenada #blackmailer pressure of the strongest operators in the market, neither in the business of the bookshops, neither in the of the sale by catalogue, neither in the electronic trade.
This Parliament, the European Parliament, has the moral obligation to express his solidarity with the #afghan women, to request to the UN that take part more actively, to ask to the States members that follow without recognising the diet of the Talibans until #this access to respect the human rights and put end to the discrimination of the woman.
Gentleman President, is a pity that in the first intervention that  *me allows to make as new deputy have to talk of some grave errors committed in my country, in the first place in companies that supply the matter prevails of the *piensos for animals, afterwards in the services of control commissioned to discover any failure that produce  and to limit his consequences; also, and especially, in the Administration of #that then that was losing the time during weeks and that *nos has prejudiced enormously by not communicating to time to the European Commission and to the States members it that was occurring.
And *yo wanted to, through *usted, ask to the European Parliament that, in the first place, support the efforts of #all the political strengths for *propiciar a dialogue among #all the political representatives; second, that this Parliament request *encarecidamente to ETA the definite abandonment of the violence, and, in *tercer and last place, that also #can agree programs to help to the victims, to the *reinserción of the prisoners and by the education for the peace in the Basque Country and in *Irlanda of the North.
They have despised the capacity of this Parliament to exert of autonomous way the competitions that *le attribute the Treaties, with the result of the current situation: the impression, in the public opinion, that we #can not *pronunciarnos on the future Commission without a report that, by very important that was and by very expert that they are his authors, is not determinant for our political decision.
A complex organism like the European Union #can not dispense of the continuous relation with his inhabitants, final addressees of #all his decisions and political; without embargo, the process of unification #can not advance without the conscious backrest of the citizens, without the disappearance of the unemployment and the creation of a new economic development.
Gentleman *Prodi, the Group of the Environmentalists *le has suggested to modify the cast of wallets in the breast of his squad because, in addition to the integrity and the competitions of each commissioner, consider that his personal commitment and his determination to defend the matters that  *les have entrusted in the perspective of #one *Europa federal are also an element of assessment important.
In the first place, the commitment to gather  what before with the members of the commission to conceive a new program of social action that cover #all the mandate of the new Commission and recognise the realities of the new world that has brought achieve the euro and the new possibilities that give off of the Treaty of *Amsterdam to boost the employment and the opportunities and struggle against the insecurity and the exclusion.
Gentleman *Prodi, estimated candidates to Commissioners, the enlargement, the external politics and of security, the strengthening of the free trade in the world, the opening of new markets, the continuation of the liberalism in *Europa with a greater competitiveness for our common coin and a forceful environmental politics, are subjects for the that *Europa goes to need a strong Commission and that work well in the that *usted, professor *Prodi, goes to have our confidence and approval for his squad.
The European Parliament, by his part, loans  to the game with *delectación, since the text presented to vote titles  Project of decision on the election of the Commission designated, *cuando, in reality, results more that evident that do not treats  of an election neither in the level of our Assembly, in the that of it that treats  *jurídicamente is of the approval of the designation of the Commissioners, neither to *fortiori in the level of the constituents that, at least in *Francia, and surely in #many other countries never have heard to talk of the Mr. *Prodi.
In wait of an indispensable *reorientación of the political axes of the Commission and a debate on the future action, has to interpret  the positive vote of today like the option in *pro of not multiplying the crises, the blockades, in our institutions, like the refusal to look for individual piacular goats *cuando it that is in *entredicho is the political orientation and the model of civilisation of *Europa.
Therefore, it is necessary a firm political will to end to support the following steps of the international community so that there are not #indonesian conditions in relation with the intervention of these strengths and so that, was *cual was the grade of conflicts in the territory, #can guarantee  the peace and the security to the *timorenses and the humanitarian support and the development that *Timor so much needs.
Also we want to take part actively in the corresponding negotiations and *asegurarnos that the instruments of the Union are in concordance with the future Convention. With this end, the last Presidencies of the Union, after the request presented by the Council in October of 1998, have conciliated his positions regarding the fight against the delinquency organised in the meetings in *Bruselas of mixed commissions and of the Committee *K.4, the *cual works in fulfillment of the article 36, #as well as in the negotiations that celebrate  in *Viena.
Among my dispatch and the services of the Parliament has glided  *algún error and #would want to say, to facilitate the things to the President in exercise, that the question is the following: whereas the citizens of the States Joined go in freely in #all the countries of the European Union, the citizens of determined countries of the European Union need visa of the North American embassy to go to the States Joined.
Subject: Construction of a nuclear head office in the south of *Marruecos Has knowledge the Council of the project of construction of a nuclear head office in the south of *Marruecos for *desalinizar waters of the sea and, in his case, #can consider argue with the alternative #moroccan government to this project, in view of his eventual environmental effect and of the dangers for the security of the zone?
To begin, *permítame express the gratitude of the Commission by the thorough report of the Commission of Development and Cooperation and by the support received during the procedure of query to the efforts of the Commission of face to the celebration of the *Décimo Agreement among the Community and the Organism of dramas public and aid of Nations Joined for the refugees of Palestinian in Orient Half.
By these reasons, receive with *beneplácito the commitment of the Commissioner *Byrne to concede the maximum priority to the *inocuidad of the foods and also the statement that took the President of the Commission, Roman *Prodi, in this Assembly on 23 July, *cuando said that #one of the first tasks of his Commission #would be the to restore the confidence of the consumers in the security of the alimentary products.
In this context, two have to be, to my trial, the immediate goals of this Assembly: take operative the parliamentary structures of the forum *euromediterráneo in the understanding that it #can mean an useful instrument to ensure the peace, and translate to the practice the initiative of the Speaker of the Parliament, the Mrs. *Fontaine, to make #one turns by the region.
Now well, the States Joined are *signatarios of the International Agreement of Civil Rights and Politicians, of the Agreement against the Racial Discrimination, #as well as of the Agreement against the Torture, that applies  in the case of *Moumia, since the racial factor weighed a lot in his process, and the seventeen years that has happened in the runner of the death constitute, according to these treaties, an unfair punishment, equivalent to a torture.
Gentleman President, costs the pity stand out that we are getting at the end of a period of five centuries during the *cual the only way to authenticate documents and transactions was the signature written or the signature certified, etc. Now, in less time that the half of the life of a person, go in in a world that goes to be dominated by the electronic trade, by new technologies and by signatures that do not exist in the ancient meaning of the word and that, therefore, it will be necessary to authenticate of an unpublished way.
The most important has been that this year have had to live the experience of a war in #european territory, a war caused by the gravest rapes of the human rights and by the politics of expulsion of population and ethnic cleansing carried out by the diet of *Milosevic; a political that #one *Europa democratic and a democratic community of nations, engaged with the defence of the human rights, #can not tolerate.
In this context *yo also wanted to highlight, nevertheless, that no only treats  to begin to give answer to the priorities in the field of the external politics, as for example the reconstruction of *Kosovo, but that to be able to *organizarlas and *impulsarlas of reasonable way is precise that the Council also approximate  to the position of the Parliament regarding the organisation of this help and to the operation of the future agency for the reconstruction of *Kosovo.
Without embargo, *me disappoints that they are taking  reductions in the global budgetary endowment, but expect that the European Council, *cuando get the moment to review the *segunda reading of the budget of the EU for the year 2000, take into account the recommendation of this Parliament to increase the finance of the program until 67 millions of euros or 53 millions of #irish pounds in the assignment of the next year.
Given the commitment collected in the Treaty of *Amsterdam to incorporate the interests of the consumers to #all the other areas of performance of the EU and the level *irrisorio of the budget for the politics of the consumers, that situates  in a 0,25% of the total of the cost of the EU, is necessary to begin by *asegurarnos that they keep  valuable programs like the plan of distribution of milk in the schools.
It has to treat of a misunderstanding because it that the Federal Reservation publishes two times to the year in his report *Humphrey *Hawkins for the Senate is a series of figures for #one those that indicators constituting the series the individual forecasts of the members of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, *provenientes of the regional banks of the Federal Reservation.

#If now the Commission do not uses #all the necessary energy to protect this *pilar fundamental of the common politics of the fishing, as they are the agreements *pesqueros, then the pressure of the professionals of the sector #would be important and founded, to end to demand the *cuestionamiento of the politics *pesquera common and the *restablecimiento of a bilateral frame, that allow the direct celebration of agreements of fishing among States members and third countries, that #would respect and #would defend better the vital interests of our villages.

Sure that it is not a fully satisfactory solution for the doctors, but in this so complex subject have to take into account the politics of the States members on the systems of health national, on the reality of each country, on the period in the that the doctors are in training and that it is a transitory period and like this try find, with realism, an intermediate solution that *nos allow, finally, step but.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00481999 of the Mrs. *Quisthoudt-*Rowohl, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the conclusion of the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technological among the European Community and the Russian Federation *COM19990324 - *C5-00831999 - *19990133CNS
The amplitude of the discussion and the varied suggestions that produced  in the breast of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects and that referred  of way very general to the politics of employment *me moved to make in the project of my report a division in conclusions, on the one hand, and in a legislative part, by #another, the *cual concentrates  in the proposals for the guidelines of the year 2000 that they have to be adopted by the Council of Ministers in December of 1999.
*Me Seems insufficient the coordination among the labour politics, of employment, of government of the market of work and the politics that *inciden in the structural factors and in the frame *macroeconómico; *me seems insufficient the level of structuring, of investment in effective community Institutions and able to govern these processes for the *cuales no only is sufficient the respect to the competitions and to the prerogatives of the national states.
And since they have listened  #a lot of interventions and proposals of his *señorías on the paper of the Commission in the institutionalisation of goals for a more resolved action, want to stress that the #european strategy for the employment happens by the support and the impulse of the national politics and in this frame try to keep the narrowest collaboration possible with the States members.
Gentleman President, have to say that it manifested by the Mr. *Vattimo do not corresponds to the reality because the Speaker of this Parliament limited  to mention *cual was the vote in the Plenary on a resolution of the European Parliament that invited to #all the States members to respect the commitment of the parity of the educational system, or was, to facilitate the parity of the educational system.
Regarding the question of the permeability among these two categories, *me allow to call the attention on the fact that we will debate on how #can  *reagrupar the credits that in the agricultural sector -and here in the categories *1A and the measures of regulations of market that did not employ  because of the evolution of the prices and of the market and that then #can be available for other measures- in the frame of the debate on the next report.
In my opinion, only the EU is able to take it, needing an active strategy that, by a part, take upsetting in the efforts in the community field and in the active cooperation, especially with the countries in development, *ayudándoles so that his energetic systems are more ecological and, by #another, show that in fact it #can  change of course without great costs, since they are #many the environmental benefits that obtain  when limiting the dependency of the fossils.
The Commission follows very concerned by that there have not been tangible advances up to now by part of the States Joined in his commitment with seen to the modification by the Congress of the Title 4 of the law *Helms-*Burton, especially because the Government of the States Joined has remembered periodically that, of not to take this modification, the President is forced to impose the application of the Title 4.
They cover, among other things, the compensation, the psychological treatment and doctor, the assistance to the victims for the collection of the debts, the transmission of the decisions of a Been member to #another to improve the protection of the victims or ask to the courts that accept the testimonies written of the victims that #can not assist to the seen of the courts against his aggressors for living in another Been member.
Besides, the Council has communicated that is had to support, using #all the means near at hand of the European Union and of the States members, the development of other sources of energy electrical to substitute to the nuclear head offices little reliable, taking into account, to #the same time, the global situation and the characteristics and own needs of each country.
My question to the Council is the following: had account of this terrible precedent, is had the Council to consider the possibility of *presionar to the authorities of *Myanmar so that they declare a total amnesty for this type of prisoners political and, in this same sense, has treated in #any occasion the Council on the possibility to impose economic sanctions to *Myanmar until it adopt a political more humanitarian?
. *FR The cycle of the #Millenium, that will initiate  *próximamente in the breast of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, the *OMC, has to be the occasion, for *Europa -place that  *nos has imposed the condition to have to talk with an alone voice-, to show  no only joined during the course of the negotiations, but also show the greater firmness regarding the results, specifically regarding the agriculture and to the cultural exception.
It True is that this goal appears around questions so notable like the alimentary security, the public services or the intellectual property, always in favour of a blind liberalisation of the financial capital and without respecting the labour norms of the *OIT and the environmental norms internationally approved and with consequences *nefastas for the cultural identity of the villages and the own development of *decenas of countries, in particular of the poorest.
It did not fits the lower doubt that the difficulties are still #many, already was in the sphere of the humanitarian help or in the of the support to the reconstruction or even because they follow producing grave rapes of the human rights, especially in the western part of *Timor, with the activity of the militias, that have prevented the *reagrupamiento and the return of the refugees of *Timor Oriental to his houses and to his earths.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the continuation of the debate of the report *A5-00631999 of the Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, of Justice and of Inner Subjects, on the communication of the European Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on a plan of action of the European Union in matter of fight against the drug 2000-2004 *COM1999239.
I say it also in name of our absent mate #Jan *Andersson, the one who - now will go back on *ello -, in what #swedish deputy, was in an especially difficult situation because *Suecia is #one of the States members that has a very special approach in politics of resultant drugs of his experience and of his national tradition and, without embargo, create, has procured, precisely in the amendments of transaction, Mrs. Deputy, get to a wide agreement with *usted in the final editorial of this report.
I believe that the words of the Mr. *Medina *Ortega have been *clarificadoras regarding the approach and to the posture -to the that it has got  by unanimity in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market- with regard to a transcendental subject, an important subject for the Canarian islands, but that has a reflection on the rest of regions *ultraperiféricas of the European Union.
It knows  that this country has *subscrito agreements to inferior price to the real cost of the production benefiting of the international supports, by mediation of the International Monetary Bottom, after the #asian crisis, it that is disturbing the wallets of requests of the countries of the European Union, as they have manifested the business organisations of the sector.
Finally, wish *referirme, because I proceed also of a peripheral region, to the enormous impact in the regional development that has the naval industry, *asentada in #many of these regions, in big part included also in the Goal *nº 1 of the #european regional politics, with *importantísimos dockyards generators of #a lot of direct and indirect employments, a social balance of the that so needed are the countries of the cohesion, that demand the #european solidarity.
The works initiated in *Tampere with seen to the preparation of a Letter of rights fundamental and the possible reform of the Treaty to separate the fundamental and essential acts of the disposals of application: in this way, they #would convert  in more comprehensible the essential acts and #would speed up  the procedure of modification of the less essential acts.
I believe that this Parliament did not has to conform with asking take part in the works of the Conference, #as well as in the of the preparation of the Letter of rights fundamental, but that it has to pretend act like a true Parliament and pretend likewise that, with occasion of the Conference *Intergubernamental,  *le return the right to decide *autónomamente his place of meeting not to be forced to work with his Secretariat in three different forums.
The monetary politics did not goes to be in conditions to reinforce the credibility of the #european integration in favour of the growth, of the employment and even of the investment, #if to #the same time that in the unification and centralisation of the monetary politics the States members of the European Union do not put  of agreement also in the signals against the *dumping public prosecutor, against the *dumping social and in favour of a greater employment.
. *FR In spite of his very limited character and clearly insufficient in attention to the problem treated, *nosotros will vote positively the relative directive to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of the health and the security of the workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres, in the measure in that it #can represent a progress in the countries in that the workers are less protected.
Also in relation with the day of the Monday, is to say, today, concerning the recommendation for the *segunda reading on the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone and the proposal of resolution on the labeling of edible produced from organisms genetically modified, the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer asks that they displace  these two points, in view of that his examination in the Plenary #would coincide with the meeting of the Commission, it that #would not be practical precisely.
The negotiations have to restart in the field of the World-wide Organisation of Trade and *Europa has to be fully conscious of his paper, a paper of balance and responsibility, with regard to a globalisation with human face, open and available to the changes and to the accelerations of the economy, but also able to protect the right to the work and to the defence of the environment and of the health.
I believe that *ustedes have put in clear that the European Union is in conditions no only to assume a paper leader in the frame of this round of negotiations and also in the frame of the next world-wide round, that do not take part here like players of *póker to impose our interests but that also are had to receive on board to the other nations, especially to the nations in roads of development and to the less developed countries.
The Parliament wished to go further of it that proposes the Council in the fight against the juvenile unemployment and of long length, especially by means of an integration on a long-term basis in the market of work through an intensification of the active measures in front of the passive, or was, increasing the proportion of unemployed that receive initial professional training and of improvement or of professional reconversion, as the fault of places of work is only a face of the coin.
Since it listens  and it reads  with frequency that the responsible networks of the traffic in question have his main bases in *Ucrania, the Czech Republic and *Rusia, that the cities of *Estambul and *Budapest constitute the most important centres of said traffic and that big part of the transport of the material in question makes  by routes that cross the *Balcanes, #many of the *cuales cross *Kosovo, #which is the posture of the Commission in this grave question and how the confront those countries in #whose territory takes place this dangerous illegal traffic?
Taking into account the existent bonds among the Council *ECOFIN and the Council of Governors of the *BEI, #can indicate the Council #if it thinks to take measures to take more transparent and accessible the relative information to the decisions of the *BEI, in particular *cuando these decisions have important repercussions in the development of a region, and #if it do not considers that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the activities of the *BEI introducing procedures of management and financial accounting in the that they take  fully in consideration to the costs related with the environment?
Subject: 50 anniversary of the Agreements of Gin In the context of the 50 anniversary of the Agreements of Gin, and to the sight of the conflicts armed that they have developed  in the world in the last years, especially the that have had like stage the #european continent, how reflection #can take the Council on the state of fulfillment of the humanitarian International Right that contain the mentioned agreements of Gin?
Gentleman President, the Council *le remembers to the Mr. deputy to the Parliament that the Council adopted the Directive *91628CEE, that remained modified by the Directive *9529CE, on the protection of the alive animals during the transport, by means of the *cual remained ratified the applicable rule to the transport of animals in #all the territory of the EU, included the norms on the maximum time of transport for different animal species.
Since it listens  and it reads  with frequency that the responsible networks of the traffic in question have his main bases in *Ucrania, the Czech Republic and *Rusia, that the cities of *Estambul and *Budapest constitute the most important centres of said traffic and that big part of the transport of the material in question makes  by routes that cross the *Balcanes, #many of the *cuales cross *Kosovo, #which is the posture of the Commission in this grave question and how the confront those countries in #whose territory takes place this dangerous illegal traffic?
The Council has not agreed that it produce  a postponement of a year, but that has given  by fine a conclusion that is of the following tenor: #if the Parliament accepts an amendment to this report, that treats of the labeling, and do not leaves to happen the proposal of the Commission without presenting amendments, the Council, then, will not accept this modification and will not follow the procedure simplified.
First of all it wanted to say to #all those colleagues that in January and February  *opusieron to the motion that created the Committee of Experts Independent thinking that it treated  of a species of hit of hand to sink it #everything through the creation of a committee, that think that now they give  account that  *equivocaron of plane so much of point of sight as of reasoning, and that, at least, #would have to withdraw #all the criticisms that took then to this dynamics undertaken, *me seems that positively, by the European Parliament, by #that that voted in favour of the creation of the Committee of Experts Independent.
In the European Union that day to day develops more his relations with third countries; politics that, as #all comprise, is connected with #some looks of the chapter on justice, security and freedom in *Europa, as, for example, the look of the immigration and the asylum. The Council of *Tampere is called also, *señorías, to confront the questions of the freedom, the security and the justice for the citizens in relation with the new realities that result of the new challenges that compose the step of the century *XX to the century *XXI.
Also it is true that the experiences of the past have carried to the Parliament to *desconfiar and to suspect that the reallocations of resources pertinent of budgetary lines no exhausted in the bottom are a practice *premeditada, since the budget always includes priorities of the Parliament that do not enjoy of #a lot of popularity and that the other institutions are not had to apply unconditionally.
The #european letter of the fundamental rights , that supposes  has to elaborate the European Council of *Tampere, will not be more that a group of words hollow #if it do not contains like minimum the total freedom of circulation and of installation for #all #that that reside and work in the European Union, #any one was his nationality of origin, #as well as the complete equality of rights, included the right of vote.
I believe that, in the first place, it recommends  aptly the foundation of an organisation, but that do not has to limit to the investigation of the seismic phenomenons and to the prevention of the earthquakes, that until the moment is scientifically impossible, #such as they ensure the *sismólogos, and #this #would have to know it our colleagues, that propose the creation of an institute for the prevention of earthquakes, but that it will have to indicate regulations and specifications of constructions *antisísmicas, of materials of construction adapted, etc., and will have to contribute to the best information of the #european citizens, loomed by the diverse calamities #as well as to that comport  adequately in #this.
But I believe that #all have to recognise, gentleman President, that have had five years of prolonged and tortuous negotiations on #all class of products: from the apples, the pears and the asparagus until the flowers, the fish, the wine, the port and the sherry, but now see that in his moment there will be an agreement and is to expect that the Monday  firm in *Sudáfrica.
Therefore I approve the amendments presented by the Mr. *Langen, to demand that the Commission exert a more active paper to end to boost a strategy of promotion coordinated in the breast of the States members and to develop the potential of *Europa in the field of the export of the relative technologies to the renewable energies.
#If it do not wishes to engage in this road, will correspond then to this Parliament go back to the strict application of the Treaty, article 272, and give the means - *algo that it #can take - so much in the field of the commitments as of the payments, to vote the credits to the height of the commitments that are the political commitments of the European Union and in the strict respect by the Treaty.
The *ECON also considers that it is an absolute priority the finance of measures on the taxation, because this sector follows being a field of irregularities in the inner market and, therefore, the line *B5-3001 on the application and the evolution of the inner market will have to keep in the level that has proposed the Commission in his project.
To my seem, in the decision of the Thursday happened also influenced the already registered descent and the *ulteriores reductions that expect  in the prices for the consumer in the sectors of the telecommunications, the electricity and the financial services, like result of the competition and the liberalisation of the markets, to the equal that the fall of the prices of the oil.
To part of the fact -and #this #can be *algo embarrassing- that virtually, in the Council of Government, never vote, so that never there #be at all that publish, do not go to repeat #all the arguments against of #this, the *cuales already have presented to the Parliament in previous occasions, but it is necessary to remember that the decisions of the Council of Government of the system of the Euro adopt  of collegiate form and therefore only it arises an only decision.
For *ello have set up a wide politics of State to struggle inside the frame of the law against the groups armed to the *margen of #this; to guarantee the security, protection, support and freedom of action for the defenders of the human rights; to attend to the persons displaced by the violence; to adopt the legal instruments that protect the human rights and strengthen our device of justice.
Another point has been the adoption of measures concrete in relation to the fight against the crime organised, as, for example, a greater operative competition for the *Europol, an Academy of Police European or measures more strict against the wash of money and the cooperation with the countries candidates, as with frequency are the countries origin of the crime organised.
*Segunda Contradiction: the Council of *Tampere announces the platonic will to administer the migratory currents and struggle against the immigration *clandestina in the origin, but to #the same time proclaims firmly, in varied occasions, that it is necessary to concede to the legal immigrants -quote- a group of rights uniform so next as it was possible to the of the citizens of the Union and that has to apply  *prioritariamente a politics of integration that *les allow to remain.
Already it is more that hour to act in the level of the Council and of the Commission and -*me *atrevo to say it like conclusion of my intervention- of *ello depends, of course, the coherence of our societies, the social peace, the own survival of the #european idea, but also the very understood interest of the company in his *globalidad and, therefore, the solidity of the #european economy.
In the last years, included the #spanish democratic stage, have known varied situations #where the fishing always has been a pending subject among the parts by the subject of the existent dispute to the hour to define our territorial waters in relation to the #african neighbouring villages.
Memory that, with occasion of the negotiation of the Agreement of fishing that now expires, the Group of Left Unitary European  *opuso to that got  to the signature of the Agreement *pesquero by means of the granting of contingents additional for the import of fruits and vegetables in the frame of the parallel negotiation of the Agreement of association.
On the one hand, there #be the need of *sustanciar the same existence of the European Union converting in effective in #all the States members the application of the decisions taken in the competent instances in the matters of competition community and, in particular, in the cases like the tackled, susceptible to invalidate #one of the fundamental suppositions of the Union, is to say, the free circulation of commodities.
Goals that, in accordance with the strategy of the great orientations of economic politics, are not another thing that achieve facilitate the goal of stability of the monetary politics by means of some budgetary measures and an evolution *salarial suitable and more favourable, in these conditions, to the growth and to the employment, included the types of change and the types of interest on a long-term basis.
In the agenda of morning appears the debate of the question of the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi on the strategy for the realisation of the only market European and the past week examine in *Estrasburgo the possibilities to deepen and consolidate the dialogue *macroeconómico with the Parliament, in the context of the debate of the report of the #ECB.
From this point of sight, of the dialogue *macroeconómico with the representatives of the *empleadores and of the workers, it only that it #can go out well is the adaptation of the collective negotiations and the readjustment of the wages to the requirements of the financial capital, of the euro and of the predominant economic politics that sees  expressed in the *UEM and in the pact of stability.
Gentleman President, *me seems that the #many things that have said  #can schematise  of the following mood: or the dialogue *macroeconómico is a pure hypocrisy for *paliar the fault of a true economic politics for the Union, and then it that said the other colleagues is totally useless, a calque and a loss of #time; or well the dialogue *macroeconómico is *algo true, substantial, and then there #be hypocrisy by the #another side, is to say, tries  hide with words *insustanciales a danger that, in my opinion, evolves to the *dirigismo in the #european economy.
Certainly it is to appreciate that it recognise  the fundamental paper of the school to win the unemployment, without embargo, lacking any reference to the need that the school act in the field of a global territorial planning that see the participation of the social speakers, the local entities and the business world.
Wish, in particular, take #some observations on the reasons that *me have carried to vote in favour of the strategy for the inner market, but before taking it, *permítanme say also that have voted against in the question of procedure to postpone the vote on the subject of the fishing, because *me will be of the all impossible assist to *Estrasburgo inside two weeks and #would have wished enormously express my solidarity with the fishermen to the part of *Escocia, in particular, with #that of the islands and zones separated.
The European Parliament and the Council buy to very low price his tranquility of consciousness, because in addition to the private violence and of the relative to the sexual exploitation, it is necessary to recognise the increase of the social violence, that results of the aggravation of the poverty and of the intensification of the misfortune in the popular classes.
The insistence in the need to influence on the reflections of the population and the habits of consumption and to establish currents of communication with the citizens and the small and medium enterprises confirms the importance that will have the political leadership on the change of our habits of consumption and the promotion of a sustainable development.
The resolution of the Parliament *nos remembers to #all the external dimension, #this is, the process of enlargement and the relations with third countries, especially with the countries in roads of development; *nos invites to adopt a realistic approach, balanced and flexible in the preparation of politics, look especially important to the hour to examine the energetic combination and his evolution in the time.
And, finally, in relation with the amendment *nº 19, comprise the sense of the proposal, but signal to the attention of His *Señorías that the relative norm to the translation of the decisions do not fits in a regulation on competition, recognition and execution of judicial decisions: the own place for the norm on translations is the directive on the transmission of the acts, the #another instrument that today debate and in the that it establishes  precisely his possibility of translation.
In my quality of speaker of opinion of the Commission of Subjects External for the report on the actions in the nuclear sector in favour of the *PECOS and of the new independent States, approved by unanimity on 27 October of the past year, have underlined the capital importance of the security *considerándola a requirement for the adhesion to the Union of new States members.
The Council of the Union, in his Common Action of 24 February 1997 relative to the action against the traffic of human beings and the sexual exploitation of boys, requests to the States members that proceed to a review of the legislation and of the procedures in vigour in these spheres to end to watch by that the types of behaviour mentioned are object of effective penal sanctions.
Gentleman President, is a question that arouse to the protect of the section 2 of the article 112 of the Regulation in relation with an appeal of statement of procedure of urgency that have presented three hours ago regarding the Report *Napolitano in application of the article 115 of the Regulation, so that it announce  to the Assembly the presentation of this appeal of debate of urgency and proceed  in consequence, so as to that we #can respect the terms of debate and vote that fix when elaborating the agenda.
Therefore, to respect the Regulation of this Assembly and the Regulation by the that they govern  the deputies, to guarantee that the deputies enjoy of the rights that *les awards said Regulation, the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, with support, as it announced  before, of the Group *PEE, requested the postponement to guarantee that *nos adjusted to the article 112 of our Regulation on the application of the procedure of urgency.
It #would be the #willing #finnish Presidency to recognise that they still have to celebrate varied meetings of the Council before it finalise his Presidency and that it #can *utilizarlas like a very useful precedent to establish his *credenciales in terms of opening - *algo that, *me fear, do not exists in these moments - guaranteeing like minimum that *cuando publish  the communiqués of press at the end of the meetings of the Council, said communiqués of press collect exactly the sense of the vote of each country on each #one of the subjects subjected to vote?
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00591999 of the Mr. *Pirker, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the proposal of regulation *CE of the Council *COM1999 260 - *C500821999 - *19990116CNS relative to the creation of the system *EURODAC for the comparison of the digital prints of the applicants of asylum and other foreigners.
Regarding the enlargement of the *OMC so that it include also the investments, volume notes with satisfaction that the European Parliament has manifested  *fírmemente #one and another time in the sense that it do not is necessary to repeat the errors of *AMI, that the responsibilities of the investors according to the guidelines of the *OIT and of the *OCDE have to define to #the same time that the right of the investors, and that -by a clear majority- it is necessary to establish a European Code of Behaviour for companies multinationals amends 15.
4 in accordance with the positions that always have defended in this Parliament, on purpose of the review of the Treaties of *Maastricht and of *Amsterdam, in the sense to keep consecrated the historical balance founder among great and small States, #can not approve this resolution that opens the box of #Pandora for a Treaty that accepts like just the supremacy of some States on #others, in comparison with the principle of equality among #all the #european citizens.
I know well that the alcohol produces dependency and also that there are persons that dies owing to the abuse of alcohol, without embargo, there #be a fundamental difference in the case of these substances, because in the majority of the cases to the persons *le results possible to control his consumption of tobacco and alcohol in a different measure to the that *les is possible to the immersed youngsters in the abuse of drugs.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00771999, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, concerning the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone 574831999 - *C5-00341999 - 19980228 Speaker: Mrs. *Hulthén.
In general lines, also is favourable the trial on the strength of intervention fast of the European Union, although there #be had #some #discordant voices regarding this matter, as it always has *sucedido in the history no only of the European Parliament, but of #a lot of national Parliaments, *cuando treats  of problems that in some mood *atañen to military looks, that #can  or #can not  talk of a #european army.
Recently the Court has confirmed that, although a Been member authorise the games of chance, #the same has the faculty to put limits to the offer gave said games and *ello in consideration to the goals of interest public like the control of the wish to play, the prevention of the frauds or of the offences and the employment of the benefits obtained for ends of public interest.
*Me #Would enjoy to know #if the Commissioner #would suit in that the two last deputies that have asked to the Commission the adoption of measures #would take better in asking to the leader of his own party, Mr. *Blair, that reduce the very high level of the pound -kept in a level too much #alto by the high types of interests of the Realm Joined- to a realistic level and also achieve that the Mr. *Blair initiate the campaign to adhere  to the euro, with it that there #would be greater transparency.
Therefore, to the sight of the previous experiences and also of the statement of today, *yo want to direct a very clear warning to the Council: #if for the spring has not reached  a satisfactory solution for the programs *plurianuales bear *Kosovo and the *Balcanes western, accompanied of the corresponding commitment of the Council, will have to manoeuvre in waters very difficult in the frame of the budgetary procedure of the year 2001.
It is true that, in the #european budget, acts  worse *cuando carries  out of the #european continent: 10 millions of euros for #Asia central, 14 millions and half for the populations *desarraigadas of *América #latin, 4 millions for the human rights in *África *austral and in *Timor, etc. *Eso #would be well #if, during this time, did not consider  the possibility to reduce in 5 millions of euros the credits in favour of our beekeepers, by true, to the that take the competition the imports of honey adulterated of the foreigner.
#One of the advances achieved in the meeting of the Monday of the Council of Environment is the adoption of a common posture by part of the Council, in relation with the strategic Managerial call of evaluation of repercussions in the environment, the *cual offers a splendid instrument to evaluate the effects in the environment of different programs and activities, included the effects of the atmospheric broadcasts.
The Committee of conciliation has got likewise to a commitment according to the *cual the program *Socrates will contribute to the development of a #european dimension of the education and of the training , in place of an educational space European , as it had asked the Parliament, or of an educational cooperation , formulation of character feebler, that the Council had preferred to the principle.
It That has put  in *entredicho is not the existence of norms #tending to organise the international trade or the own existence of a world-wide organisation of the trade, but the fact that the *OMC pretends to be the source of #all normative, the referee of #all the things, the supreme judge of the future world.
According to the rules of the external politics and of common defence, according to the *cual the States members coordinate, after all, his performance in the international organisations, the initiative and the power of decision are totally in hands of the Council, in the practice, in hands of a group of civil servants skilled that have a natural tendency to concentrate  in his own problems.
#If the Mr. deputy to the Parliament wants to know more of the real conditions of the transport of animals or wants to put the subject in knowledge of the Commission, perhaps was convenient that *le formulate the question directly to the Commission, since it is specific task of the Commission control the fulfillment of the disposals of the valid Directives or take part in the subject *cuando the disposals are not fulfilled.
Improve the small and medium enterprises and favour measures that contribute to improve his competitiveness has been #one of the goals of this Parliament by the fundamental paper that exert in the creation of employment and for considering that #any one actions oriented to the small and average economic operators boost the economic growth European in general and signal a safe path to reach the economic and social cohesion of the Community.
#If well the current normative capacity in the frame of the European Union did not allows still the adoption of a legal diet *transfronterizo in this field, expect that in a future #this was possible, especially after the Ministers of Culture of *Austria and *Alemania, in February of the past year, considered that this question, in what #such, *reviste a character *transfronterizo and like this have manifested it by writing.
I believe that it is very important that explain that the terrible rapes of the human rights, like the that have lived and live in #Sierra Lion, are *algo that to *nosotros like Europeans *nos *incumbe, because according to our conception the human rights and the human dignity are indivisible all over the world and because we are not had to tolerate this selective conception that conducts to that we allow that the acts of violence that produce  in our vicinities *nos seem more conclusive that the eruptions of violence, like the that witness in #Sierra Lion from takes #a lot of years.
Obviously, #this is not the opinion of my Group, neither neither the opinion of the Committee of Experts, that in the chapter 7 declares *pertinentemente that the distinction in the breast of the Commission among politics and management is not *defendible, quote, neither *jurídicamente neither in the practice, that this distinction allows to skew the political responsibilities, that it logical is that it was deleted in benefit of the hierarchical subordination regarding the politically responsible commissioners.
*Usted *nos Has presented in the person of the Mrs. *Schreyer to a politics experienced that it still will need a shooting in #any that another subject of field #european, since first it will have to  adapt to #some moods of operation, but that has put  to the day quickly and of exhaustive way on the very complex subject of the budgetary politics and that it is very conscious of the future challenges in this field.
Gentleman President of the European Commission, #would wish to begin in the point in that it has remained  the Mr. *Donnelly, the *segunda splits of his mission, the program of work, because I believe that, more that of the collective or individual responsibilities, that, of course, consider also important subject, the work of restoration of the prestige and of the creativity of the European Commission depends especially of the program of work.
I have to say that so much to the pensioners that *me have commanded to this seat number 270 of the European Parliament, as to me *nos has satisfied the comment of the Commissioner designated Mrs. #Anna *Diamantopulu that, when answering to #one of my questions during the auditions -with regard to the *cuales it is necessary to remember so much it that it was very as it that - did not answer that has very in account the problem of the greater persons that expect a pension and that the fifteen States members no longer is in situation to pay, since the Insurances are feeble and have deficit.
To his time, at all has advanced  on the need of *imposición public prosecutor to the movements of capitals, regarding the need of adaptation of the national social diets to the current demographic tendencies, it that shows that, to end of accounts, the goal is not a greater social justice, but, to the contrary, #one *agravación of the social inequalities.
I request that the institutions of the European Union support the sending *urgentísimo of a strong civil mission and of a strength of security of the Nations Joined, of proportional dimension to the gravity of the situation, to achieve that *Timor constitute  like independent State, it that will demand long along the *cual the Nations Joined will have to keep an unambiguous support and the European Union a help *apolítica and economic indispensable.
The *segunda is the following: I Want to take an urgent appeal to our European Parliament so that, when talking of the #indonesian question, take a clear distinction among the military diet of Indonesian, the elections that celebrated  and that they were a reflection of a long and deep process of transformation that only finishes to begin in an enormous empire of the that *Timor Oriental is not more that a small fragment, and the big suffering of the #indonesian village.
The concealment of a common pit in the that *yacían the bodies of 15 #serbian murdered around the middle of July in the outskirts of *Gnjilane, zone under responsibility of the #american troops, poses serious *interrogantes around the paper of the call *Afuerza of peace\@, since in function of his tolerance or support, the #serbian population of *Kosovo is victim of an extended ethnic cleansing that shows the difference of sensitivity of the international community about the protection of the human rights, that gives  by safe.
Without embargo, regarding the composition of the council of direction of the agency, do not comprise the reasons that #would have to induce to the Parliament to foresee the nomination of seven independent experts only by part of the Commission and #this against of the proposals formulated by the own Commission that, in dissonance with the Committee attach to #the same, has foreseen, by the contrary, the presence of a representative of each #one of the States members.
In the section 3, the European Parliament demands an open and innovative approach on the character of the Letter, the nature of the rights that will have to appear in *ella, #as well as on the paper and the position of #this in the constitutional evolution of the Union , it that shows his will of not to limit, simply, to collect the rights in vigour, as it asked the Council.
A fraudulent escape of the money of help foreign, a flight of capital #russian in the last ten years estimated among the 150.000 and 300.000 millions of dollars and a #russian economy that has gone back to the trade of barter *nos prevent to have really contrives of the *envergadura of the financial crisis in the Russian Federation.
Lady Speaker, in my opinion the Parliament #would not have to leave without taking advantage of the opportunity to take a statement on the mandate in the turn of the *WTO, because the Council of Ministers will give the mandate to the Commission on 13 October and #would be really a pity #if this mandate awarded  without knowing it that thinks the Parliament of *Europa on the subject.
Of course, it results ironic, as we said yesterday in the Commission of Development, that the Commission of Budgets voted the past week to reduce the budgetary line on the attention of the reproductive health and the work in matter of *HIVSIDA to the half -of 25 millions to 12 millions of euros- and that now are examining the need of investment in this sector.
Therefore, welcome are the campaigns of information oriented to sensitise to the public opinion on the subjects related with the energetic saving, without embargo, do not see how the adoption of measures legislative excessively strict #can be the most effective method to improve the energetic intensity of the final demand.
Consistently with his obligation to defend the interests of his States members; consistently with the values of equity and social progress that proclaim like #ours; consistently with the project of world that want to contribute to build, more balanced and more *solidario; but consistently also with the performance kept by #many of *nosotros and #many of our compatriots in *Europa during four decades *esforzándonos for finishing with the apartheid and dreaming with the instauration in *Sudáfrica of a diet of freedom and of dignity for #all the #south african.
Our new Parliament sends today a new and clear signal of forceful -support and sustained- to a process of peace that goes to open the path to the progress, the democracy, the respect to the human rights and the hope in the future for #all the villages of the region and for the peaceful coexistence among #Israel and the independent state of Palestinian.
We have to respect these measures, because of another mood will be encouraging of *facto the politics of colonisation, and *eso that the European Union, together with the rest of the International Community, States Joined included, always have condemned this politics and #all know that the #israeli politics of settlements constitutes a big obstacle in the long path to the peace and to an authentic #palestinian State.
So that in this occasion the road of hope that opens  after the signature of *Sharm The-*Sheikh do not remain again closed in the future, is necessary that the sensitivity and the political intelligence of the new ruling of the State of #Israel, #whose security want guaranteed, promote able measures to create a confidence sustained in the #palestinian part, so that the peaceful road, recently reopened, scope, it before possible, the dip definite.
Regarding the external politics, believe that it is necessary to insist in the fact that no only have commercial commitments, but that are linked by agreements *multilaterales on the environment, by relative international agreements to the respect of the human rights, and in my opinion -that create share #a lot of colleagues-, these commitments have at the same time in the ethical plane and in the political plane a more important value that the *librecambio.
Anyway, I have to say that the negotiations of the Round of the #Millenium do not have to prejudice the essential elements of the agricultural model European neither the necessary reforms so that, in addition to it agreed in the Diary 2000, protect  the internal development of the territories of the goal 1 with familiar exploitations based in the earth, in front of the interests of the great industrial companies and of big distribution.
To me *me #would enjoy to ask to the Council, that no to the Commission, how values in general lines the development of this campaign; #if it is truth that #this has been a good year for the tuna and #if therefore they have averted  the conflicts among the distinct fleets that fish in the *Cantábrico; how number of ships has reduced each country like consequence of the moratorium; #if this method is revealing  as valid to brake the pressure on the populations of tuna.
Regarding the question of the assignments for the structural measures, the divergences among the Council and the Parliament  summary in two points: in the first place, the amount of the advance of the relative payment to the new structural actions and, second, the calendar of the settlement of the ancient permissions that still have not paid .
Since a big part of the community budget executes  by means of the States members, *yo *le #would recommend sincerely to the Council that watch by the efficiency, the transparency and a clean execution in this field, so that the Commission do not go back to see  forced to follow resorting in the future to the procedure of approval of the management in interest of a clean execution of the budget.
*Yo Want to express, therefore, first of all my *congratulaciones and my gratitude to the Monetary Institute European, to the national banks, to the Central Bank European, represented today here by his President, Mr. *Duisenberg, but likewise to the States members, that promoted through numerous necessary political reforms the *ulteriores structural and institutional reforms and fulfilled the criteria of convergence, and also to the citizens, that are supporting with an increasing consensus this necessary step to the #european integration
Our Group receives with satisfaction the training of an organ for the preparation of the Letter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in the belief that the wide parliamentary scope of his composition reflects the realisation of the process of democratisation of the better EU that the usual Conference *Intergubernamental.
They remain, without embargo, two obstacles: firstly, the abandonment of the community preference in the agricultural field, and already know the problems that exist in the sectors of the tomato, or of the horticulture; and, the second point, with regard to the *cual #can not yield, #would consist in an exchange of the right of fishing for the Spaniards by a supplement of immigration, in #one *Europa that has 18 millions of unemployed.
By it that refers  to the report *Cunha on the celebration of a new Protocol by the that they fix  the possibilities of fishing and the financial compensation, foreseen in the Agreement with the Republic of *Angola for the period comprised among 3 May 1999 and on 2 May of the 2000, wanted to signal that it treats  of a classical protocol, that makes possible the access to the resources *pesqueros during a period determined and fixed #one *contrapartida financial.
With my innocence and naivety, *yo had thought that, *cuando the Managerial Committee Scientist gathered  the past week and took his announcement -in fact, took it the Mr. *Pascale, French *él, like President of said Committee-, in the that indicated the unanimous approval of said committee, in the sense that the meat of bovine British is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of the EU or possibly more that #any of the world, already had got  to the top of the pyramid.
Gentleman President, wanted to congratulate to the speaker Mr. *Hughes, regarding the ordination of the time of work of the persons of the sea, by his proposal to the Parliament to approve, without modifications, the common position of the Council with regard to the application of the labour day of the persons of the sea on board of the ships that use community ports.
Also I expect that the procedure by the that *nos have seen forced to examine the present Communication in the Parliament do not take  like model for the future, since it also has been the cause, gentleman colleague *Lehne, that we have not had the opportunity to debate the amendments in commission and *nos to forced to proceed of a very atypical way for this House.
But a true social support to the goals that determine  with the persons in difficulty in the frame of procedures formalised is the only mood that the helps and incentives for the research of employment *surtan #all his effects, no only in the own access to the employment, but also in *algo that is intimately associated to #this, is to say, the *reinserción durable of some persons that are totally #wear# out by the destructive process of the unemployment.
We consider important that carry out in the stage of programming to allow to the workers anticipate the change, expand the field of application of the directive and guarantee that #the same contain minimum prescriptions to scale community that #can not break but in the most favourable sense for the workers, #as well as extend the content to the matters that affect directly to the rights of the workers and his future.
This strategic option referred , first of all, to the approval of the directive on the #european company and afterwards to the approval of the directive on the query and the information; and all #this in the logical that #if had priority the directive on the that are debating, #would be *complicadísima the vote of the directive on the employment that, as well they know, carries in the table of negotiations more of 14 years.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, agrees with my considerations that with the proposal that *usted takes, practically suspend  the obligations of the Council derived of the compulsory credits but that keep  his rights, to know, the reduction of the credits no employees, and that in this way happen in fact of the compulsory credits to the no compulsory without that the Parliament obtain the rights of sovereignty on this sector in the budget?
In the breast of the Western European Union, the subject of the guarantee of defence mutual has even more forces that in the breast of the NATO; in the neutral countries, the general opinion in these moments is that the commitment of defence mutual is not applicable.
And as I have heard to say to the gentleman *Bourlanges in the debate that the next Conference *Intergubernamental #would have to decide the creation of a #european tax, *yo #would say, to the contrary, in name of the Group *Europa of the Nations, that #if the *CIG has to treat this problem, is precise to decide the creation of a clear system, transparent, *equitativo and, especially, controlled closely by the national democracies, *me refer of an annual contribution of the States based in a percentage of his *PNB identical for #all.
We have presented a proposal of strategy to combat the drug in the EU during the period 2000 - 2004 following the lines guidelines of the Council of *Europa, the work that made the previous country that had the Presidency, the communication of the Commission and the contributions that have taken the States members and different groups of work to the communication of the Commission.
Considering that of agreement to the article 255 the general principles and the limits of the right of the citizens to the access to the documents of the quoted institutions have to establish before 30 April 2001, in compliance with the procedures of decision of the European Parliament, the Council will begin to study a proposal of regulation so prompt as it was possible.
Lady Speaker, to win time, now that the amendment 70 of the Group *Europa of the Nations has remained refused by an overwhelming majority, perhaps #can apply *usted the disposals of the section 7 of the article 130 according to the *cual, after the approval or the rejection of a concrete amendment, the President will be able to decide that other amendments of content similar or with similar goals subject  to vote jointly.
The position initial negotiator of the European Union, ambitious in his goals, is allocated to not going out strengthened of a cycle of negotiations that #can *eternizarse and stagnate to cause, in particular, of the predictable attitude of the States Joined, that will try constantly destroy the unit of this mandate that possesses the Mr. *Lamy, and that do not represents more that an apparent unit, unable to dissemble the divergences of interests among the Fifteen.
The only solution is to reestablish the controls in the inner borders of the Community; to endow to the services of police of the States members with the human means, financial and materials to fulfil his mission of protection of the persons honoured; renounce to award to the irresponsible of *Bruselas any type of competitions in police matter, judicial and of entrance and permanence of foreigners.
The situation of retard aggravated by the vindictive destruction *perpetrada by the strengths armed #indonesian, the small dimensions of the territory, associated to the circumstance that there #be another half of the island, the coexistence with neighbours and powerful interests, the nonexistence of an administration, are elements that contribute to the complexity of the task and give idea of it necessary that it is the participation of the *timorenses and it important that is the international solidarity.
We will loan our full support to the responsible of Nations Joined, the Mr. *Kouchner, and his ancient colleagues, *cuando at last begin to set up an administration in *Kosovo in place to leave this committed in hands of the false and illegitimate Government of the *ELK, *cuando the municipal authorities and the city councils of the villages and of the cities leave to be governed by the *ELK, *cuando these tasks and other #many that remain for taking in *Kosovo are carried to good term, #if no by other #Kosovar, by other agents of Nations Joined.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00511999 of the Mrs. *Rühle in name of the Commission of Budgets on the proposal of decision of the Council *COM1999142 - *C5-00391999 - *19990080CNS by the that concedes  to the European Bank of Investments a guarantee of the Community to absorb the losses that derive  of loans for the realisation of projects out of the Community *Europa central and oriental, *Balcanes western, #mediterranean countries, *Latinoamérica and #Asia and Republic of *Sudáfrica.
Gentleman President, wanted colleagues, take the word in this point to express my support and the of the Socialist Group to the work and to the conclusions on the proposals that today presents in front of the Parliament, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical, my good friend and mate the professor #Manuel *Medina, with the hope founded that #ours Assembly approve with #all his weight the proposals in question.
Gentleman President, have taken the word to show first of all my surprise after having listened it that *nos has declared the Speaker in exercise of the Council regarding the Conference *Intergubernamental. The Mrs. *Halonen not even has quoted the resolution of the European Parliament of 18 November and the proposals contained in #the same referents to the diary of the Conference.
Economic problems, problems of human rights, of democracy, of respect to the minorities. Problems, in end, of security and stability in the *sureste of *Europa, by what *Turquía bases his external politics well in the violence declared, as in the case of *Chipre with the prolonged occupation of the north of the island, well in the threat to use the violence, as *cuando the #turkish Parliament declares officially *casus *belli the exercise of the #greek rights of sovereignty on the territorial waters of the *Egeo.
In fact, the liberalisation of the market, the cancellation of the subventions, the impunity of the investments, the commercialisation of the services, even of the education, of the health and of the culture are loaning service to the great interests of the capital *monopolístico to increase his benefits; without embargo, are not at all appeals for the workers neither for the villages.
Here it is precise rather play in the future a preparatory paper more intelligent and more marked to end to take patent how interests represent really in common in these world-wide rounds and why the need: in concrete, to control the globalisation, to contain the spontaneous growth that, in any case, #would produce  without the world-wide round, and to carry out here an intelligent strategy of solution of the global problems.
Already I have underlined the importance that the Commission assume also his responsibility regarding the States members, but *cuando treats  of internal politics, the external help and the administration of the personnel, #can impose requirements clearer to the Commission and #can also tackle the subject of way different *cuando treats  of the Statement of reliability, *algo that have begun to take and that will follow taking.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00971999 of the Mrs. *Pack, in name of the delegation of the European Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation, on the conjoint text, approved by the Committee of Conciliation, of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  the *segunda stage of the program of action community in matter of education *SOCRATES *C5-02671999 - *19980195COD.
As a result of the queries that have made to the Common Centre of Investigation and to the States members in particular, have got to the conclusion that the 1% is the commitment that better fulfils two purposes: in the first place, the goal to establish a level of tolerance very low that involve the effort of the operators; and second, that take into account the necessary feasibility in #all the chain of production.
In the first place, it wanted to *decirle that his small delay is perfectly justified by the importance of his communication and also that the Parliament  *congratula that it was possible this form of debate practically immediate and instantaneous among this Assembly and the Executive and takes votes by that this new method get for real to create a space of debate political current, that by strength has to *enaltecer to this Assembly and his relations with the Commission.
In the first place, it wanted to say to His *Señoría that share the worry that finishes to express concerning that the #european institutions in his group are able to formulate a politics of information and of communication that allow to take get to #all the #european citizens no only the tenor of the debates, but also the value added that for his daily life have the decisions of the Parliament, of the Commission and of the own Council.
As it planned, will be necessary *ponderar the actions in relation with the civil situation, economic and social of the distinct New Independent States and of *Mongolia using two parameters: the solution to the problem of the destitution and of the social and economic marginalisation, without privileges and graduations, and the evaluation of the civil strategic value, economic and social with regard to *acercar the villages of the New Independent States and *Mongolia to the European Union.
The European Union has to take all it that was in his hand during the next year so that they find  the most efficient solutions possible from the point of sight environmental and of the reduction of broadcasts, solutions that was possible to approve at length, with the end to get to an agreement on the rule of the mechanisms of *Kioto and of the application of the Agreement.
#This is it that #would have wanted to say to the Mr. #Martin, #if #this, of a way that estimate little *cortés and little according to the requirements of the democracy, to the respect of the right of the minorities and to the parliamentary habit, had not decided from the principle, without at least *haberme listened, that the observation that *yo thought to take regarding the articles 180 and 181 of our Regulation was not a statutory question.
*Nos Find in a back procedure to the decision of 1997 and it more #likely is that we go back to *encontrarnos in a back procedure to the current decision. Without embargo, by the sake of the consumer #would have to have elaborated previous query to the Parliament a plan of work to guarantee a correct application of the system of identification compulsory inside the term established.
In spite of the previous resolutions of the Parliament, supported in the report of the International Federation of Human Rights -that confirms the precariousness of the conditions of arrest of the political prisoners-, the maltreatments, the humiliations, the attacks to the physical integrity of the individuals, are common coin in the prisons of *Djibouti, especially in the of *Gabode.
It #would give *usted to the majority of the Assembly, of circumstantial form, the possibility to pronounce  on the political affinities that they #can exist among #such or *cual deputy that has stamped his signature to the foot of the writing of constitution of a group and know very well that exist, also in the breast of the majority groups, factions that are not neither with a lot of agreement among *ellas on a common political program.
Therefore, it wanted to go back to remember that in the last session *plenaria *yo signalled that, of compliance with our Regulation, the Assembly decides on the composition of the tables of the delegations *interparlamentarias, but corresponds to the mixed parliamentary commissions proceed, as they take it also the parliamentary commissions, to the election of his tables, #such as we have taken it in the Commission of Subjects Inner, for example, and in #all the commissions.
For example, it is not possible to detain the delinquency organised, the traffic of persons, the bleaching of money and the terrorism only through the police collaboration, #if to #the same time allows  the free circulation among the countries members, so much of the community citizens as of #all the other, and much less #if the surveillance of the external borders sees  weakened, it that it is unavoidable with the enlargement of the Union.
It #can not  admit that the key field of the justice, that no only affects to the protection of the citizen of face to the outside, but that also guarantees the protection of the citizen in front of the state institutions, do not take into account the protection against erroneous executive measures neither the corresponding control in benefit of the citizens.
Amen of *eso, has not had any objection in accessing to the proposal of the #french Government to assign to Pascal *Lamy the wallet of Trade External, although this gentleman is the architect of the system #Jacques *Delors . With this system has implanted  in the Commission a financial structure totally #abstruse.
Always I have been of the opinion that a military intervention foreigner only had to take place in the national interest of the nation-Been that it treat , and without embargo the grave deterioration and the spiral of violence in the region required the adoption of measures and fulfilled the conditions of the new external politics ethical concerning the *cual *Portugal is Been member of right plenary.
In the resolutions adopted in June of 1999 on the *preparativos of the third meeting of the Ministers of the *OMC, the Council remitted  clearly to the agreements of the Bosses of State in the Summit of Colony the days 3 and 4 June 1999, in the *cuales supported  some negotiations that cover a wide fan of subjects, among *ellos the labour norms, like the best half to achieve substantial results and balanced in benefit of #all the members of the *OMC.
The Commission already has remitted a document to the Presidency of the Council and to the Parliament in the that proposes a clear division of the functions of the services of the agency and of the personnel among *Pristina and *Salónica, with #all the operative services centred in *Pristina and the director of the agency rooted there in his centre of operations.
Report *A5-001099 of the Mrs. *Morgantini, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation on the proposal of decision of the Council *COM1999 334 - *C5-00591999 - *19990143CNS by the that approves  the text of the *Décimo Agreement *CE-*OOPS for the period 1999-2001, before the signature of the Agreement by the Commission and the Organism of Dramas Public and Aid of the Nations Joined for the refugees of Palestinian in the Near Orient
Likewise, the services of the Commission, that has managed the helps to *Rusia, have to elaborate a report on the modalities of employment of the bottoms and, finally, asks  the creation of a commission of investigation, composed by the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the *BEI and the *BERD, that check how many and #which finances sent to *Rusia have used  for the planned ends, for example, the program *TACIS.
Regarding #Grecia, already it has said , the damages also have been great, have thrown roots in the population - have visited the zone - the anxiety by the morning, especially for having ascertained that, in the construction of the houses, it that predominated was the benefit and no the care to the persons that were paying for buying  a house.
The *avispados advisers that are to my side *me say that according to our Regulation, has been correct the behaviour of the Parliament and of the President of session, my predecessor, as in the agenda says  that among the 15 and 16 hours will take place the statement of the Commission on the financial crisis in *Rusia and that the debate of urgency will begin immediately after the statement of the Commission or to more take to the 16 hours.
The *segunda will be the of how competitions will transfer *usted of the Commission to this new agency and maybe to #some of the that already exist, so that they #can exert better his tasks and assist to the agency commissioned of the *inocuidad of the foods in the resolution of the relative problems to the foods in *Europa. How it will guarantee the surrender of accounts of these new agencies? It #would examine *usted, for example, the possibility to celebrate auditions here, in the European Parliament, to choose to the directors of said agencies?
Alas, to date, in #a lot of cases, the citizen only receives with hindsight information on these subjects of the daily life that *le affect, *cuando in a so delicate field the performances #would have to have preventive character, of #such mood that the alimentary chain ensure really the corporal and mental welfare of the consumers and do not convert  in object of speculation for the economic interests.
The resolution is at least a statement of our position on our relations with our big neighbour, and #if the Parliament had not expressed his opinion on this important subject, #would have supposed a *incumplimiento of his responsibility like international parliament, and a #sad indication that the politics of the Fortress *Europa is alive and receives more support of the that had to in the breast of this Assembly.
In the Protocol of *Kioto, and also in the agreement on the climate, stipulates  that #if a community of nations with economic cooperation, as it is the case of EU, do not fulfils in his group the commitments purchased, the responsibility *recae on each #one of the integral states of the community, is to say, that #if #some States members do not fulfil the goals, #all the Union suffers the consequences.
But also it has to ask to the services of *Euratom that effect a complete analysis of the group of the official regulations of security of our head offices, and around the head offices, in *Europa, to know #if it respects  the group of the conditions of security; to know #if still they #can  add procedures of urgency in case that they produce  regrettable human negligences, that are worse, especially in these last years, that an unpredictable accident that, by definition, #can seed the panic.
I #can not finish my presentation without *indicarles that #this is not the only solution of the problem and that our Parliamentary Commission wishes to put of relief the need that other parliamentary commissions occupy  of this risk for the security in the next directive on broadcasts of commercial vehicles weighed and also in other norms of proof of vehicles, for *cerciorarse that the cover defective of deposits of fuel withdraw  of the circulation, was in full road, was in annual proofs of the commercial vehicles.
Concerning the worry of the Parliament by the possible resultant consequences of the transfer of the assignments of the category 4 allocated to the provision of help to the less advanced countries, do not have to forget that, of compliance with the Agreement of *Lomé, the European Bottom of Development funds the helps of the EU to these countries.
Our positions of principle in this sense, together with the balance among independence, reliability, transparent advertising and the necessary consolidation of the monetary dialogue, are from our point of seen decisive elements to judge the work of the #ECB and also for the formulation of our report and the approach of the procedure of work of the Parliament.
Wail, therefore, that frustrated  in the stage of commission and have not presented  today in front of this Assembly the attempts to demand to the Bank that published the names of the assistants, the vote on the monetary measures, after a period of grace of some two years, #as well as the publication of the models *econométricos of the #ECB.
The Commission will open also a debate on other important political fields. The prevention of conflicts, the previous forecast to the crises and to the catastrophes and the humanitarian help based and focused to the human rights, is to say, the humanitarian help that centres  more in the human rights of the victims.
The new global approach that has decided  give to the subjects of immigration and asylum, #as well as the commitment of the European Council to apply entirely the Convention of Gin on the Statute of the Refugee and the decision to aspire to a #european system of asylum are steps in the correct direction.
Lady Speaker, the Council of *Tampere that finishes to devote  to the #european space, called of Freedom, Security and Justice adopted #some positive technical decisions to intensify the cooperation in the fight against the delinquency and favour the judicial coordination, by means of a greater utilisation, for example, of the mutual recognition of the judicial resolutions in civil or penal matter that *usted same, lady Speaker, recommended, by it other, in his preliminary speech.
My Group had expressed the wish that like this it was from the case *Michelin: said of another mood -as it finishes to repeat -, the simultaneous announcement fact by the direction of this big company, in front of financial analysts, of the #obtaining of benefits substantial, by a part, and, by #another, the decision to suppress in *Europa 7.500 places of work.
#One, that *me #would seem quite positive, #would consist in creating an instance of *concertación of experts in the #european level without subtracting the minor can of decision to the national states on the fundamental matters, the most next to the worries of the citizens; the #another, that *me #would seem much more negative, #would consist in creating a supplementary element to deprive to the nations of his right of *salvaguarda, that, without embargo, is inalienable.
The transparency of the process, regarding the preparation of the general guidelines of economic politics and the guidelines in matter of politics of employment, consolidates  more with a *dictamen official and public of the Economic and Social Committee that with a query of character *tripartito that, at most, #can *tipificarse like obligation of prudence and diligence #Can the Commission answer the question of how sees the relation among the dialogue *macroeconómico proposed and the Economic and Social Committee already existent?
By the contrary, why #can not say that #if we are able to invest the tendency to the *decremento of the economic growth, thanks to the liberalisation and thanks to knowing accept openly the challenges of the new economy, there will be wealth and will exist the possibility to increase the wages *vinculándolos to the productivity and to the results of the companies in place of *vincularlos to the national collective agreements or Europeans.
Of here that *me seem regrettable that now, to the principle of the process, the parts give the impression to protect  in the importance of his own autonomy in the field of his competitions: the administrations concerning his budgetary politics, the social speakers concerning the negotiations *salariales, and the Central Bank concerning the monetary politics.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, the present managerial form splits of the strategy of reduction of the broadcasts CO2 in the field of the transport of the EU, the *cual supports  in four *pilares: information to the consumers -the present managerial-, fiscal stimuluses of the States members, surveillance of the broadcasts of CO2 of the vehicles of tourism and the Agreement among the commission and the car industry.
The fact that it was difficult remains shown by two circumstances: a common agreement almost general on the urgency and the importance to adopt effective politics to struggle against the unemployment and with regard to that #this occur inside a frame in that the necessary support to a positive economic process keep the social cohesion and the social model European.
The structural unemployment possesses varied indicators: labour costs excessively high, deficient flexibility in the labour days and in the biographies of the workers, an industry of services insufficiently developed, a regulatory density excessively high by part of the state and of the bureaucracy, speeds of innovation too much slow, periods too much long of transfer among the scientific knowledge and his put in practice in the production.
In this sense, think to treat the subject in the next ministerial meeting of the European Conference of the Civil Aviation, that will take place on 28 January next, and, #such as I have indicated before, the communication of the Commission devoted to this question will present  to the Parliament to finals of this year and to the Council of Ministers of Transport, specifically in the meeting of 6 December.
To his *Señorías *les corresponds a fundamental paper to the hour to reflect these points of sight and to contribute to the preparation of an external politics and of common security more effective, more coherent, nearer to the worries of the citizens and that reflect the values and the principles that have forged our identity like Europeans.
It had wished, gentleman #Solana, that was more explicit on the bottom of this essential question and that *nos said how, in the field of the *PESC, went to contribute to correct, in the measure in that it still was possible, the most disastrous consequences for our continent of the actions that *usted same, #if it has not ordered, at least has protected in *Yugoslavia whereas General Secretary of the NATO and that today have in front of *nosotros.
In these decisions are also the commitments of the States members to build a specific military strength that strengthen the capacity of the EU to make #worthy actions of credit, in accordance with the principles of the Convention of Nations Joined, without that put  in cloth of trial the particular interests of *algún Been member and without that the EU take #his the fundamental missions of the NATO.
The main focus of attention has to be the consolidation of a world-wide order of the trade and the opening of the markets or have to put in a *primer plane the defence of our economic and social model European, of the social and ecological economy of market and of the community politics that come developing in favour of the interests of the citizen and of the consumer?
Gentleman President, it that it is necessary to appreciate in the Report *Schwaiger is the attempt to conciliate it that up to now has resulted *irreconciliable, and the considerable effort of the speaker notes , definitely, from the *primer considering, in that to the recognition of the strong increase of the world-wide exchanges, thanks to the relations *multilaterales, #can not but *contraponer the fault of a substantial reduction of the economic inequalities in the world.
By the contrary, #if we take a road integrated of the bond among intellectual property and development, simultaneously to the extension of his guarantees, have to watch for boosting the direct investment like main vehicle of transfer of technology to these countries, #as well as for developing with *ellos agreements of technological cooperation and perhaps -launch this idea- by *reflexionar on the reinforcement of the #european investment in fundamental investigation on the living beings to share the benefits with *ellos.
Had account that the proposals of the Commission -and to this *respecto am very grateful to the Mr. *Barnier- foresee a similar division for the procedures of modification, *me seems a sample of *pusilanimidad that the Commission of Subjects Constitutional of this Parliament yes approve the division in two of the Treaties, but do not accept the differentiation of the procedures.
Without embargo, want to indicate that, from the point of sight of the Union, probably is quite better the politics to adopt a constructive attitude so that *Turquía do not give entirely the back to the European Union and leave to try fulfil with the principles that *nosotros have added in the criteria of *Copenhague for the adhesion and in other #ours resolutions.
For example, the final mandate awarded by the Council, on 22 October, do not mentions the defence of the principle of the community preference, in spite of having been approved by the Council Agriculture of 27 September, the *cual had not been of the all satisfactory, when forgetting the principle of the alimentary independence in *Europa.
How they #can sue the villages of *Europa the *reforzamiento of the international paper of the EU with the creation of a new political entity and juridical and with the impulse of a defence and common security, *cuando the EU is responsible, beside the NATO, of the first action of war after the *Segunda World-wide War, the aggression, in break of #all notion of right international, against *Yugoslavia?
But #this has posed inconvenient, because the problem that has Canarian, like other regions *ultraperiféricas -*Azores, *Madeira and the #french departments of *Ultramar-, is that they are regions very #move# away of the community territory, divided in small insular territories, with markets very reduced, with some problems of transport enormous and, besides, with derivative difficulties, for example, of the excess of population, of a diet of rains very irregular and of poor floors, that prevent that they develop  normal activities.
*Cuando Prepared yesterday my intervention on the Reports *Morillon, in a text of the European Parliament, of the Secretariat of the Group of Work for the Enlargement, of International and Institutional Relations of the General Direction *IV, under responsibility of the Mrs. *Martine *Chariot, in the point 6 of the report on the relations of *Turquía with the European Union affirms  *algo surprising and of the all unacceptable:
But also I want to say that in the Basque Country is absolutely necessary a political commitment as in *Irlanda, of #such form that do not costs the *cerrazón, even the reactionary character -#would say *yo- of the postures of the #spanish Government, that denies  to accept a political commitment with the national parties Basques in the course of the process of peace.
A last information: the Mrs. *Maj *Britt *Théorin, speaker of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, has adopted an initiative that *me seems of it nicer, the to send to #all our masculine colleagues a letter for *animarlos to carry a white bow like signal of his public commitment of not committing violences neither *excusar or *callar the violence against the women.
In the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, in view of that there #be parity among the world of the sport, on the one hand, and, by #another, the of the governments and that #all the members of the council of administration, therefore, also the federations and #all the national olympic committees, have engaged  to put in practice, each in his field, the decisions adopted by the agency, there are hopes.
In the future, beginning with the budgetary exercise 2001, the procedure of configuration of the budget of the EU will have to follow the political priorities more *marcadamente that up to now ,and to this *respecto the decisions about the priorities do not have to cover only the operative means but also the necessary personal resources so that it take a greater assignment of personnel there #where are the political priorities.
But it had celebrated that owing to the adjusted result of the vote that had in the commission -a vote of difference- had shown  *algo more of disposal for the commitment by part of the speaker and of his group, since -I say it today very clearly- #if we vote the Wednesday and our amendment 7, the reduction of the contingents of base to 500, is not approved go to vote against of the whole of the report.
As a result of the European Council of *Helsinki, on the *cual has celebrated  this morning here, in the Plenary, a debate with the presence of the President of the Commission, #this has approved a proposal of decision of the Council with seen to the official approval of the lines guidelines for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000.
From the point of sight purely financial, in addition to the technical assistance with charge to *PHARE -22 millions of euros- and the financial protocol, a subvention for the payment of the interests of the loans of the *BEI that rises to 20 millions of euros, have devoted 143 millions of euros of exceptional assistance to help to this country to confront the consequences of the crisis of *Kosovo.
And the paper of the European Union, of the Commission and of the European Parliament in this sense is important, since, as it has signalled , there are #a lot of agreements signed among the European Union and *Macao. It is well that, during the next 50 years, the European Parliament and our #european institutions #can follow the evolution of *Macao, a lucky evolution, create *yo.
Regarding the decisions on the granting of credits of the European Bank of Investments, the mentioned project *Gardaland has been treated before in the Parliament in the turn of questions oral to the Commission and, according to the information received by the Council, in this occasion exposed  very in detail the arguments that defend this project and his advantages, so that I do not go to go back to *repetirlos.
Likewise, the Council loaned attention to the approach of the Commission in relation with a structural reform of the aerial space wider, #whose goal is to create an aerial space uniform in *Europa, and received also with satisfaction the purpose of the Commission to create a Group of high level that study the looks of this subject and present to the Council a report *aclaratorio the next June.
The Council is conscious that, in the case of the Mrs. Titin *Loizidou, the European Court of the rights of the man considered that *Turquía had violated the European Treaty for the protection of the rights of the man, to the *inculparse in the undue appropriation of the rights of property in *Chipre of the North, and condemned to *Turquía to effect compensations.
The Council underlines that #all the States members voted in favour of a transitory resolution on the subject, that was approved by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of *Europa on 6 October 1999 and in the that signalled  that the conditions of payment proposed by the Government of *Turquía #can not be considered satisfied with the obligations imposed by the sentence of the Court and also exhorted  to *Turquía that reviewed his posture.
By #everything *ello, in the *50º anniversary of the Agreements of Gin, and *cuando owe *comprometernos #all -the Parliament, the Commission and the Council- to boost the knowledge of the humanitarian international Right and support to the organisations that have like responsibility his defence,  *le occurs to the Council #any concrete initiative to spread the humanitarian international Right among the citizens of the Union?
In the Directive *9858CE of the relative Council to the protection of the animals of breeding declares  that it will not administer  to an animal #any another substance, with exception of the administered for therapeutic ends or *profilácticos, unless scientific studies of the animal welfare or of the experience established have shown that his effect is not hurtful for the health or the welfare of the animal.
Have the security that our European Parliament is very satisfied for having taken part in the pressures of the international community, that have contributed to that the #indonesian President *Habibie have released it the past 7 September, little after the referendum of 30 August, in the that the 70,5% of the population of *Timor Oriental pronounced  in favour of the independence.
Therefore, *señorías, the commitment to the that get with the Commission of Budgets consists in not approving more that the loan of 75 millions of euros, agreeing - a position of the Commission of Industry that has comprised , create, by part of the Commission of Budgets - in that *Tayikistán #would owe also can enjoy of a supplementary help to lighten the monthly charge of the debt, 200.000 euros, *algo that it is *insoportable for this country.
The Government, first did not know how was it that was happening, adopted a posture of total indifference, next wanted to throw earth on the subject until after the elections and finally took  manager of a reaction of panic evidently exaggerated that caused all over the world a boycott of the products called #belgian but of the that the first victim has been my country, *Flandes, since the greater part of the exports called «#belgian» of course are exports of *Flandes.
Lady Speaker, to difference of the previous orators, that were #all of #english nationality - watch by where!-, *yo #would wish to protest against the decision of the quite surprising -Commission, to my mood to see- to impose a sanction to the #french Federation of football by a supposed discrimination in the sale of entrances in the last Glass of the World of football.
Although my rules of hygiene mental for the weekends *me have prevented to devote to the reading of the report the hours that definitely deserves, believe that has an additional virtue little appreciated by my predecessors in the use of the word: in #a lot of points collects positions of the Parliament and proposals that were not received *favorablemente in his day.
#One of the extenuating circumstances on the lacks of the Commission, that  *trasluce along the report, is the fault of means with the that explain the services of the Commission to carry out the politics that *nosotros, deputies, agree in the field of the cooperation for the development and of the humanitarian help, flags both of the community external action.
I comprise the comment of the Commissioner about the subsidiariness, but are arguing because in the Parliament there #be a directive of frame minimum that did not invades the subsidiariness and that solves the problem when creating the obligation in the States members to establish an inspection inside some wide guidelines.
It say here that the commission of investigation on the linen in the Congress of the Deputies already has approved his conclusions, declare clearly that this commission has exempted of any responsibility to the Mrs. Of Palace, situating the responsibility of the management, control and granting of the helps in the #spanish Autonomous Communities, notoriously in the governed by #one of his *correligionarios in *Castilla-The Stain.
Finally, regarding the space of justice, our purpose #would have to be the to take all it possible so that the citizen have the feeling to find , in #all the territory of the European Union, in front of a frame of justice that was suitable and in the that they protect  his rights of way similar, no only in front of the criminals, but also even in front of possible excesses of the public powers.
The constructive participation of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence and the Commission of Budgets of the Parliament also deserve my gratitude, and inside a moment will happen to comment the amendments presented by the Commission of Budgets, subject to the that has referred  the Mr. *Khanbhai.
The paper of the Commission and of the #european institutions has to, in the very concrete case of the alimentary security, limit to negotiate the principle of caution in the frame of the international agreements and to coordinate the politics of the States members and of the European Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-001699 of the Mr. *Langen, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to a program *plurianual of promotion of the renewable energies in the *Comuniad *ALTENER 1998-2002 7122199 - *C5-003299 - *970370COD.
The Parliament expresses, besides, in the section 1 of the article 1, the will that it carry out the campaign allocated to promote the penetration of the sources of energy renewable, #such as already it advocates  in the White Book of 1997, and that also they develop  new instruments and mechanisms that allow to boost a penetration accelerated and coordinated in the market of #all the sustainable energetic technologies.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation *A5-00201999 of the Mrs. *Kinnock, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, on the proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Agreement of Trade, Development and Cooperation among the European Community, by a part and the Republic of *Sudáfrica, by another 87311999 *COM1999 245 - *C5-01541999 - *19990112AVC.
And finally I want to take a question on the budget: taking into account that almost #all the transfers centre  in the category *cuarta, #this is, in the external actions of the Union, and that #this is #one of the points that produces more dissatisfaction in my Group and, in general, in the Commission of Budgets, did not believes the gentleman President that #would be convenient to review the financial perspectives regarding the external politics of the Union?
Has foreseen the Commission use methods of communication more modern as, for example, the acquisition of #time of advertising, of 3 to 5 daily minutes, issued among the #news and the sport of the main newscast of the television network with greater audience of each Been member, to present with character of divulging the attainments and goals of the EU, directing mainly to the social coats that usually do not read and that definitely are not the addressees of our material?
Support firmly the observation that has taken my colleague of the *PPE, Mr. *Bowis, that we do not owe of any way export our problem of the world developed, through the taxes on our old head offices with levels of problematic broadcast and move these places of work and these units of production to regions less developed, #where are less prepared to cut across the degradation of the environment.
Of course, they exist limits to our realism; of here that we also want to use today this moment to protest by the situation in this country, and take an urgent call to the Government of *Bielorrusia so that it take *algo in front of the disappearances and occupy  that the missing are found, so that #this constitute a reason in himself\/hisself same to initiate really a dialogue that allow the celebration of elections free and just, expect, the next year.
Among these political goals the human rights occupy a place stood out, together with the free access to the informative means, the end of the bullying against the opposition, a constructive dialogue among the opposition and the government, and the backrest to the program *TACIS of development of the civil society.
#Some of *ustedes have  *percatado surely that the plastic materials use  increasingly in the industry of vehicles of engine and this norm of proof uniform will offer to the designers the possibility to concentrate  in the fulfillment of an alone norm, instead of having to consecrate his efforts to the fulfillment of #all a series of norms different.
We have voted in this sense an amendment that corresponds to an important political commitment of this Parliament, although we vote it above the category 4, it that it wants to say that to the day of today there #be not statute of amendment, but that corresponds to a commitment of this Assembly to vote these credits with occasion of the *segunda reading, mainly regarding the agreement with *Marruecos, that is a political priority of this Parliament.
They give  account that it will be necessary to reduce in a 10 % the efforts against the mines *antipersonas, that also appear in our budgetary lines, or the measures of support to the no governmental organisations that work in the countries in development, as for example in *Guatemala or in other regions of the world, because we are unable to use the imagination, because we do not want *detenernos to consider exactly of where go to go out these resources?
In the first place, no *me seems #worthy of credit that from the European Parliament demand, on the one hand, to #all the other institutions and very especially to the Commission the most rigorous control and expect that the organisation chart of the personnel adapt  to the new requirements, and *nos propose that #this remain reflected, besides, in the #european Budget, while by the #another side are not had to act in #the same sense in our own field, regarding the budget and the administration of the Parliament.
Already it has signalled  in brief that the report occupies  especially of the year 1998, the year in the that  *dictaminó how countries -eleven in total- fulfilled the criteria of convergence, decided  where #would have his headquarters of the #ECB, proceeded  to the absorption of the *IME, initiated  the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union, and the Council of the #ECB decided his strategy of stability, based in the two *pilares already known.
Regarding his #dutch past, the Central Bank of the Low Countries, that chaired during #a lot of years, found  in the centre of the field of strengths social #where developed  the economic and social politics and *yo see it like a model for the implication of the Central Bank European in the dialogue *macroeconómico #european.
The report of the experts contained proposed on how #would have to concretise this bridge to make the transition to the help to the development or to other instruments of support to the development, as for example the programs *PHARE and *TACIS? And it has determined  #if the problems have his origin in the help of THROW and in the design of the project, or #if they are imputable to the other helps?
Without these minimum measures and #others, accompanied of concrete measures against the transfers of companies inside the European Union and other measures against the *dumping social in the outside, the social model European, so expensive to #some of our politicians, included the of rights, will not be never another thing that an empty speech, it that #would contribute to strengthen a feeling *antieuropeo diffuse in our countries and in numerous employees.
#If a part of the social speakers, the that are suffering the world-wide competition and on the that #all are, really, of agreement in that they have to be helped and protected -because *nos interest the #european companies that they #can compete worldwide- expresses his restlessness by the society and by the maintenance of the social balance, have a significant argument for the development and the support to the social dialogue.
In effect, in this delicate stage for the European Union, while it is setting up the enlargement to the East and while they are making  #all the economic and financial reforms related with the introduction of the only coin, do not have to forget the value culture , the specificities and the diversities of the #european culture, his assessment and diffusion.
Gentleman President, to initiative of the socialist Group and with the backrest of the #others Groups, the Commission of Fishing has formulated this oral question to the European Commission and to the, once again, absent Council of Ministers so that it expose  in front of the #european citizenship #which is the current situation of the contacts kept with the #moroccan authorities, with seen to the negotiation for a future Agreement of fishing European Union-*Marruecos.
After the expiration of the previous agreement, gentleman Commissioner, produced  a tie up that it lasted seven months, to the that it was necessary to add the natural biological stops and other stops no so biological and more arbitrary, imposed by the #moroccan Administration to a European Commission that did not know to defend the interests of his persons, as they test it the numerous *apresamientos *injustificados and #some even out of the economic zone #moroccan scoop.
It proposes  that the European and Chinese Union close a specific agreement of scientific and technical cooperation so as to increase and expand the cooperation, #among others fields, in fields like the energy, the environment, the sciences of the nature, the sciences of the materials, the transport, the telematic, and the technologies of the information and the communication.
A projection of these figures indicates that the #european industry invests surely among 20.000 and 10.000 millions of frames in efforts of investigation out of the European Union and #if it achieved  use the credits that the European Union puts now to disposal for *movilizar also private resources in the field of the investigation, #this #would contribute to that countries like Argentinian leave to be only extensions of the #european facilities to take part directly in the investigation and the technological development.
Already I posed the question and, very amiably, the Speaker *me has given an answer that, without embargo, consider no adjusted to the Regulation, because #if the Regulation talks of a week, a week #can not understand like seven working days: seven days #can understand like natural or working and no like a week, to the equal that a month or a year that, for example, #can not consider of 365 working days.
Besides, we support totally the proposals of the speaker on the reduction of the broadcasts of CO2, so that we reach the goals of *Kioto, #as well as the fiscal incentives for the technical adaptation of the most ancient vehicles and the adaptation of the cycles of proofs, so that they register  the real broadcasts of the vehicles in circulation, at least on a long-term basis.
In previous reports of the European Parliament already said  that the big culture of the car was the main manager of the pollution of the air in *Europa, and the Parliament exerts now an active paper in the establishment of the maximum values of the distinct *contaminantes to reach the control of this environmental problem.
I create and I expect, as, that the Parliament #can, from this report, receive income especially through this reference #as well as through #others, and seen the elements that #this contain,  #one to a formal claim to authorise to the Conference *Intergubernamental to tackle at the same time the reforms that  *nos propose and to this fundamental look of the total participation of the Parliament no only regarding the costs but also to the income of the budget of the Union.
Therefore, it is urgent to unify this energetic debate with the purpose to determine exactly our options of investment and put a #alto to these contradictions that take that five members, at least, of the European Union -*Austria, #Italia, *Dinamarca, *Portugal and #Grecia- that do not resort to the nuclear energy, #would be forced to fund a politics that is, in more of a 50%, still subsidised by the European Union in matter of nuclear energy.
I respect the reasons by the that the #british delegation has abstained  concerning the amendments *núms. 5 and 8 -auxiliary doctors-, but *yo have not followed this line, because, in the first place, treats  of a position negotiator and, second, my immediate familiar experience of #one *comadrona of the *SNS, overwhelmed by an excessive work, no *me allows to impose to some decisive medical personnel labour days longer of it absolutely necessary.
*Ello Has caused that the current #greek authorities have taken a very important decision, specifically the nomination of a new direction, resorting to expert of companies -in concrete the *Speedway, a subsidiary of *British *Airways- that they have to update the plan of reflation of the company and that, am safe, will be able to *ofrecernos along this month sufficient data and the necessary guarantees so that, once and for all, #can authorise the last tract of helps to *Olympic *Airways and reach that #this takeoff adequately and take the flight without greater problems.
It has shown a big opening, which *nos has allowed to reach commitments, no in the sense of the commitments that hide the positions that defend the different Groups, but that have struggled and have taken a true effort to achieve a #european commitment, a #european approach that express the general support to the position of the Council and of the Commission.
Thus it is indispensable that the Commission achieve a harmonisation of the tariffs and the elimination of the beaks *arancelarios and of the progression *arancelaria, #as well as the suppression of #all the technical barriers to the trade, understanding that to the less developed countries  *les has to guarantee the free access to the international market of #all his products so that they #can benefit also *ellos of the commercial liberalisation.
To finish, also *yo want to congratulate to the speaker by his excellent report and by his will to get to a consensus it wider possible on a so important subject like the next Round of the #Millenium, of the *cual depends the consolidation of a commercial system *equitativo that ensure, to world-wide level, an economic order based in the social justice.
The adherents of the liberalisation of the trade whereas engine of prosperity are so much more reluctant to this balance in the measure in that it is difficult to argue the aggravation of the situation in these last years with the reinforcement of the inequalities among the countries with delay in development and the countries advanced, like the development of the inequalities in the same breast of the countries developed.
At present, in spite of the good work of the speakers, the proposal of position of the Parliament runs the risk to be more conservative that the of the Commission, and the Group of the Party of the Liberal, Democrat and European Reformers has presented varied amendments directed to centre the approach of the report and to accelerate the development of #one *Europa parliamentary.
Nevertheless, the construction of #this *Europa do not involves to deprive to the villages and to the homelands of the *margen of autonomy that *les allows to dominate his own destination, is to say, that only #can  undertake #if it supports  in the respect of the national sovereignties, in the adhesion of the villages, in the social consensus and politician, in the opening and the transparency of the processes and in the respect of #all the integral countries.
Subject: Prohibition of supply of fuels and threat of humanitarian catastrophe in *Yugoslavia Is being very questioned and has given place to forceful reactions the opposition of the EU -manifested in the frame of the Council of Ministers of External Subjects celebrated in *Luxemburgo- to supply fuel and products of first need to the inhabitants of *Yugoslavia so that they #can confront the next winter, #as well as the final decision to supply oil, under the lemma Action for the democracy, only to two #serbian populations, *Nis and *Pirot, controlled by the opposition.
But where it is the protection of the workers, in particular against the drama of the unemployment, even in the richest countries of the European Union, precisely #that that #would have *sobradamente the means to eradicate the unemployment, #if the main worry of his governments did not go the gains of the great companies and the enrichment of his owners and shareholders?
The public and social services, like the education or the health, and also #that in the that are in game the security of the users and the collective interest, like the public transports or the aerial control, the culture and the artistic creation, #can not subject to the balances of a commercial negotiation.
Given the existence of the international agreement reached by means of the Extraordinary Assembly of the Organisation of Nations Joined in June of 1998, for a treatment balanced of the problem, so much in the slope of the decrease of the offer, as in the slope of the decrease of the demand, wanted to underline the possibilities that offers the new Treaty in his article 152.
Gentleman Newton *Dunn, as *nosotros are of the opinion that in the weighting of his proposal, by it other #worthy of attention, and of the intention that the #german Presidency of the Council had in his moment, *nos remain with the that aspires to a wider goal, will refuse his amendments, and no only those referred to the legal base, but #all #that that do not alter the fact that *usted has made an accurate work.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-005499 of the Mr. *Seppänen in name of the Commission of Budget on the proposed decision of the Council by the that concedes  to the European Bank of Investments a guarantee of the Community to absorb the losses that derive  of the loans for the realisation of projects of reconstruction of the zones affected by the earthquake in *Turquía.
They serve of example the group of prevention of *estupefacientes, that acts in the breast of the Centre of Investigation and Development in the sanitary and social sector of *Finlandia, #as well as the group *Pompidou, group of cooperation of the Council of *Europa created in the decade of the 70 by initiative of the President of *Francia for the fight against the drug addiction and that has slopes #a lot of projects for the reduction of the offer and the demand of *estupefacientes.
I believe that have the obligation bear with our *conciudadanos -and talk to the Speaker in exercise of the Council of a #nordic country that always takes #gala of the transparency- to reach a transparent process in the that, in the first place, the Parliament was properly represented and *me #would enjoy that the Speaker denied those voices that say that the Presidency  *opone to a full representation of the Parliament in the Conference *Intergubernamental with two representatives.
Gentleman President, the Speaker in exercise of the Council affirms that it always enjoys *cuando attends to the Parliament, therefore it results quite extraordinary that in his intervention have not answered to #any of the proposals of the Parliament for the Conference *Intergubernamental, it that comes to confirm the #news appeared in the press, that are reason of worry, that the European Council has chosen an agenda restricted for the *CIG and that the Letter is only *optativa.
During 1998 and 1999 with the approval of the programs of the Commission of the European Parliament through a group of work *interinstitucional, *Turquía received bottoms inside the Program *Meda and the Commission of Control Budgetary has approved the creation of this group of work during the debate of the budget of the year 2000.
*Yo Particularly think -and had the occasion to say it in the debate that kept in the month of October- that, for the first time, #all the pieces of the #turkish puzzle find  on the table: the problem of the islands of the Sea *Egeo, the problem of *Chipre, the problem of the human rights and the problem of the minorities.
In consequence, *nos seems timely that in this occasion give  another very clear signal that the preservation of the human rights and the protection of the minorities in *Turquía follows being the essential condition so that the European Parliament express his solidarity from the point of sight of the cooperation and of the support to this country.
In spite of the diverse political initiatives directed to reduce the pollution and improve the quality of the air, splits  of the base that the needs of transport of *pasajeros will go back to increase drastically in the next ten years and the number of vehicles will increase  in a 25%, it that will suppose a still greater charge for the quality of the air.
Other elements of said strategy are an agreement with the car industry on the reduction of the broadcasts of CO2 inside a term *preestablecido and a system of labeling that indicate the consumption of fuel and facilitate the election of the consumer in the moment of the purchase of a new tourism.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, as it indicates the speaker, Mrs. #Carmen *Fraga *Estévez, the presentation of the proposal of the new regulation of the Council by the that it establishes  the Common Organisation of the Market in the sector of the products of the fishing and the aquaculture produces  in a moment in the that #all the countries of the European Union constitute #one of the greater world-wide markets of products *pesqueros.
Perhaps these demonstrations served of pretext to the official protagonists of the Summit -#that that seated  of right plenary around the table of work- not to assume until the bottom the political responsibility of some certainly difficult negotiations but extremely necessary in matter of social rights and of protection of the health of our citizens, some negotiations that no longer #can expect.
#That is the reason by the that the budget of this year had to reflect in truth the need to reinforce the procedures of control budgetary and, like speaker of the budget for 2000 and in name of the Commission of Control Budgetary, wanted to receive with *beneplácito once again the creation of a new organ to struggle against the fraud and the new places of the *OLAF reflected in the budget for this year.
Subject: Publication of compliance with the article 5 of the Regulation *1965CEE of the Council of 2 March 1965 Has taken into account the Commission the specificity and diversity of the sector of the hospitality industry in *Bélgica, *afamado by the big quantity of friendly bars in the that they serve  beers of the most diverse classes, and the repercussions of the application of the Regulation of reference especially among the small employers of the sector that will see  affected?
Sure enough, there #be a *desfase remarkable among the noisy proclamations of the Union on his wish to exert a more offensive paper in the solution of the great international problems, by a part; and by #another, the discussions of dealers of carpets to the that have had to *entregarnos with the representatives of the governments *cuando treats  to look for finance for new priorities.
Without embargo, have to say that, to the contrary of it that *sucede in the national field, in *Europa have observed that the practical politics develops  above the parties and, in front of the material problems, the European Parliament is conscious of his responsibility, that of course increased  and happened to occupy an even more stood out place to the sight of the low participation in the #european elections.
#Such as it establishes the article 35 of our Regulation, the Commission of Control Budgetary, competent for this matter, listened and interrogated individually to the candidates proposed the days 22. And 23 November 1999. In said audiences, *nos guide, on the one hand, by the disposals of the Treaty, that demand that the candidates form part or have formed part in the past of an organ of control of accounts or are especially qualified for the exercise of said charge.
From the point of sight of the countries in development, the important questions are the creation of the conditions to develop his capacity to register the indexes of pollution and the development of his capacities of performance in general, #as well as the promotion of the transfer of technology.
. IN In the first place, it wanted to recognise, to the equal that am safe that it recognises #all the Parliament, the paper that has exerted the distinguished deputy Mr. *Soares no only in the restoration of the democracy, the human dignity and the human rights in #one of the great countries of *Europa, but also the historical paper that has exerted at the end of the empire and in the conclusion of an empire with #all the #decorum that has been possible, without forgetting *Macao.
The second problem is, definitely, the most important: although it mentions  in the preamble, this text do not answers to an essential problem, *cual is the investigation directed to illnesses that are not little frequent, but concerning the *cuales do not exists market for the pharmaceutical industry, in particular the illnesses that affect to populations that #can not pay his treatment: it treats , especially, of the tropical illnesses, even of the malaria and of the tuberculosis.
Whereas the previous rounds carried out inside the greater discretion, among negotiators *sagaces and taking into account only the commercial interests of his country, the next round, #whose date of start is up to now unknown, only will be able to make in the transparency and integrating in the debates #all the questions linked with the trade, to know: the social norms, the environment, the protection of the consumers, the culture.
Subject: Granting of humanitarian help to Serbian Has the Council the intention to undertake initiatives directed to send humanitarian help to the #serbian village, now that the winter is in doors, since the maintenance of the embargo -on the that has manifested his reservations even the coordinator of the Pact of Stability, Mr. *Bodo *Hombach- affects to the #serbian village in greater measure that to the diet of *Milosevic?
Of here that it value very positively the Report *Murphy and that it have voted in favour of #the same by what said report introduces again looks that the Council had deleted when elaborating his common position, but that represent an unquestionable benefit for the #SME, in particular the obligation to fix by law the establishment of some same terms of collection in the commercial transactions and the that this obligation *incumba also to the public powers.
Therefore, I believe that the Commission has applied wrongly the article 82 of the Treaty, because in this case did not treat  to take advantage of  *abusivamente of a dominant position, but to benefit , of an absolutely just and comprehensible way, of a very particular situation from the point of sight fiscal.
First, the Committee of Experts Independent recognises that, although the last responsibility of the management *recae in the Commission, did not fits to ignore that the administrations of the States members execute at least the 80% of the community budget and that his attitude in front of the fraud is not always diligent although afterwards these ministers are the that *despotriquen against the community management.
Also with regard to #this, to my opinion, *nos find in front of a true fraud, because undress of authority to the free will of some persons that organise  on the base of an article of the Regulation, is not an act of democracy and of freedom; before well, #if a deputy thought that this act has inspired  only in it that it is the economic budget of the groups and of the assistants, then *nos find in front of an authentic case of fraud.
But the question that it #would be necessary to take is #if it will not have got the moment that, #if the European Community wants to have protected sure enough his financial interests, exist a penal community Right that allow to configure like community offence, with a competent penal jurisdiction, the fraud against the financial interests of the Community.
In *tercer place, #if the Commissioner of Agriculture designated also loans greater attention to the amendments presented by the Parliament and to the own members of parliament, always that #that, just is to say it, no *rebasen the budgetary limits and do not derogate juridical acts already existent, the majority opinion of my Group is that the experience, competition and commitment of the candidate allow to conclude that it will make a fine work like member of the Commission.
Without embargo, a part of our group do not expects of the Commission an ecological approach in his performances, and from now on #all our group will commission  that the Commission respect the principle of development sustainable and make possible the creation of a *Europa of the citizens, so that both goals are always present to the hour to take decisions.
The Ministers of Justice and Inner will elaborate the subjects of his competition in an unofficial meeting that will celebrate  in *Turku the days 16 and 17 September, and the Council of Subjects General began the *preparativos of the European Council in a meeting that took place the past Monday, for *cerrarlos definitively in his meeting of the 11 to 12 October.
Report *A5-0013 of the Mrs. *Pack, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of regulation of the Council *COM1999312 - *C5-00621999 - *19990123CNS by the that it modifies  the Regulation *CE *nº 16281996, of 25 July 1996, relative to the help to *Bosnia and *Herzegovina, *Croacia, the Federative Republic of *Yugoslavia and the ancient Yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia and, especially, by the that it creates  the European Agency of Reconstruction
Inform *A5-001399 of the Mrs. *Pack, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of Regulation *CE of the Council *COM1999 312 - *C5-00621999 - *19990132CNS relative to the modification of the Regulation *CE 162896 relative to the help to *Bosnia-*Herzegovina, *Croacia, Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and to the ancient #yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia, mainly by the creation of a European Agency of Reconstruction
In *tercer place, in terms of economic support and support to the development, the commitment of the Commission in the frame of the Agreement of *Lomé #can and #would have to be reactivated with two conditions: in the first place, an improvement of the situation of the security in the *RDC and, second, a result of the national debate that guarantee a stable political disposal in the *RDC and in the that respect  the fundamental elements of the Agreement of *Lomé.
Of the recent past and of his *productivismo *descabellado inherit a situation that, in the common agricultural field - with *demasiada frequency -, has put the politics to the service of the great economic groups *agroalimentarios and of the distribution on a large scale. Result: crazy cows, chickens that poison to the dioxin , oil of casting in the oil for the consumption, muds of purification in the flours for the livestock, and do not quote more...
*Algo Very distinct to Big *Bretaña: it has not produced  eradication of the illness and the tax of animals ailing situates  still in a too much elevated level to avert any risk of pollution and to guarantee to the consumers a healthy product.
We will have to organise, therefore, a big conference on the AIDS, but without *dejarla only in hands of the countries that afterwards have to manage specifically some so dramatic consequences, but a conference, as *auguramos from takes years, in 1993, on the pandemias, the AIDS, that under our responsibility face up to this situation and arbitrate measures that correspond to an international authority, to the sight that the WHO is totally unable to offer concrete answers.
The answer of the Parliament in the form elaborated by the Commission of Budgets is that it important in this stage is to review the financial perspectives and of this form ensure also in fact the arrival to destination of the general assistance given by the Parliament and by the European Union #as well as the possibility to carry to good term these subjects.
The help to the scales of payments is a help to reinforce the reservations of a country of #such form that #can face up to his problems of payments external, that always have a compensation: always it pays  or by the provision of a service or by the acquisition of a commodity.
Thus, I give my approval, of course, to the amendments presented by the gentleman *Langen that demand of the Commission a more active paper to boost a strategy of promotion coordinated in the breast of the States members #as well as to develop the potential of *Europa in the export of the relative technologies to the renewable energies.
The technical advances of the last years have improved clearly the efficiency of the sources of energy renewable, and in place to allocate *tantos resources to the #european atomic industry, as obviously it takes the Commission, owe *redoblarse the efforts for promoting the sources of energy renewable.
The *primer moment of *apogeo of this process of democratisation were the democratic elections of 1994, the first celebrated for #all the #south african, that constituted a visible expression of the release no only of the majority of the population until then *oprimida, but in reality also, create *yo, of the privileged by the ancient system; of his release of the pressure *autoimpuesta to have to justify a system that *ellos same knew, at least in his *fuero internal, that was *injustificable and that also *les was *distanciando progressively of the persons of *Europa and *Norteamérica with the that felt  cultural and ethnically identified.
There are other chapters like the tax on the value added that require some harmonisation because, of it contrary, #would distort  the competition; likewise they exist other chapters, to know, the tax of societies and the tax on performances of the capital furniture that, by the contrary, have to be harmonised in the part in that the fault of harmonisation involves a distortion of the competition.
The one who do not recognise now that has got the hour of the truth neither recognise that it has to give  a clear and sincere answer to *Turquía, will run the risk that it do not reach  all *aquello that want of *Turquía but that produce  a very different evolution of the that we will be also responsible in the case that *Turquía do not look for already the path to the family of the community of values democratic in *Europa but in any #another spot.
Finally, it do not leaves to be, definitely, interesting observe that the cooperation that seals  of this way with this big country of the South #can contribute to the creation of effects synergistic useful for the European Union in the frame of the delicate negotiations that go  to initiate in the breast of the *OMC, from the Conference of *Seattle of the next month of November.
In effect, a fault of control on our part #would have dramatic consequences for the society, gravely affected by the unemployment 40% of the active population and #would go totally against of the efforts that the European Union makes from takes #a lot of years, through the structural Bottoms, to favour the economic and social development of the island.
But not even they have the value of #Emma *Tuahepa, the one who has  brave to ask to the #african governments it that had taken and it that are taking with the money of the #african, and it only that *ustedes have limited  to signal is that #any of the eleven Bosses of #african State  *dignó to assist to the Conference, or the importance of the cultural and religious factors in the propagation of the plague.
I think, for example, in an excessive *enfatización of the clauses of protection social, of the *dumping social there #where knows  perfectly that #this will be mere *declamaciones after the *cuales there will be swim more not even effective controls and that, in fact, only will be the sword of #Damocles protectionist for the countries in development, for the countries of recent industrialisation, that will be able to be used *cuando the old *Europa, the old *Europa of the bureaucracies, of the #sindical bureaucracies and of the industrial decadence, will find  with the water to the neck.
On 25 May 1999 the agreement was signed by the President of the Parliament, Mr. #Gil-Oaks, the President of the Council and the President of the Commission; the Council and the Commission adopted on 25 May and on 2 June, respectively, the timely decisions of his competition with seen to the application of the agreement in the breast of said Institutions.
It #would be suicidal, *contrariamente to it that #some have affirmed today, think that the #european rulers #can exert pressures so that the Central Bank *supla his inability to reactivate the economy through the structural reforms, the liberalisation of the markets, before #all the of work, and the budgetary rigour that it has to go accompanied of a reduction of the fiscal charge on the persons and the companies.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Central Bank European, *Señorías, this debate celebrates  *cuando have fulfilled  the first nine months of the life of the euro, in some conditions that allow to ensure that his introduction has been a hit, although it only was in the sense limited that the transition to the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union has produced  without greater *sobresaltos.
Another big difference is that it is very easy to try take a false note with modern technicians of photocopied it that constitutes the reason by the that the precise details of the notes go to be given to know amply but only little before his introduction to reduce the risk of the fake and not confusing to the public that is not even familiarised with the notes.
Our Group will take use of #all the means to his scope to influence in the community budgets so that they believe  the bases of a #european bottom for the refugee; subject #this, that now only went object of quotation in the decisions of the Council, urging to the Commission to study the possibility to  consider the creation of *algún bottom of reservation for situations, in the that great groups of refugees need temporary protection.
A strong signal of *Tampere that *Europa has left to be only a market and that the #european citizen no longer is only a consumer and a worker; that the citizen, whereas citizen, with #all his dimensions, with #all his worries, with #all his needs, with #all his demands, is in the centre of the #european construction.
In this occasion will have to give  a clear signal so that the process of preparation of the Letter and the Conference *Intergubernamental of the Union, that will develop  simultaneously, express two convergent dynamics, with seen to guarantee the conditions of enlargement and strengthen the foundations of the State of right in our Union of right.
Still they do not circulate the notes of the #european coin and, watches by where, already talked  in June, in Colony, of a #european army and, in September, in *Tampere, of a #european penal justice, is preparing  a Letter of Rights Fundamental and, finally and especially, the Commission asks to the European Council that accept the perspective of a *Europa expanded until the #Asia Lower and until the western borders of the *Irak and of the will go.
Report *A5-00211999 of the Mr. *Hatzidakis, in name of the Commission of Politics Regional, Transports and Tourism, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Repercussions of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course in the field of the regional politics, of the transports and of the tourism *SEC1999 581 - *C4-02191999
Have to confess -already with #any experience in the relations among the European Parliament and the Congress of the States Joined- that in the Congress of the States Joined have #a lot of friends and speakers, but that have not been able to board in any moment a positive debate with the senator *Helms, that seems that it do not has not even of North American passport and that considers, no only in this subject but in #others #many, that *él is the that imposes his law to the world.
Gentleman President, wish to support the program Culture 2000 and congratulate to the speaker, the Basque Mr. *Graça *Moura, for having enriched the group of the text with new contributions directed, by a part, to achieve greater participation of the countries and of the *beneficiarios and, by #another, to insist on the need to diversify the announcements, #as well as with his recommendations in defence of the deconcentration of the activities and great cultural events.
More specifically, regarding the agricultural chapter of the budget, is evident that even before they begin the negotiations *multilaterales of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the EU proposes  coordinate with the North American the reduction of the protection and of the interventions, by means of the reduction of the resources allocated to the different agricultural products, fact that comports new reductions in the income of the producers and new limitations to the crops.
The Managerial Committee European Scientist has to pronounce on the relevance of the #french arguments since the Monday, the group *ad *hoc that gathers to the #european specialists of the illnesses of *priones has not been able to get to an unanimous conclusion and has transmitted to the Scientific Committee European the results of his works.
It #would suit *conmigo in that the relative situation to the meat of bovine has contributed now, in front of the public opinion, to create the chaos regarding the *aceptabilidad of the trials issued in the #european level on the *inocuidad of the foods and that *eso do not presages at all good for the plan of the Mr. *Prodi to create a #european agency of alimentary security?
#If #this do not locate  and are not recognised like the real causes of the problems to the that they confront  the workers of the sea, #can not  talk neither of measures neither of the creation of mechanisms of control, for example of the rest of the workers of the sea, that only #can give of ineffective form and *hipócrita, perpetuating like this the diet of intensification of the work and of the exploitation.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00491999 of the Mr. *Gahrton, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that celebrates  the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical among the European Community and the Popular Republic of Chinese *COM19990287 - *C5-00381999 - *19990123CNS
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00451999 of the Mr. *Linkohr, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council *COM99 0292 - *C5-004099 - *990125CNS by the that celebrates  the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical among the European Community and the Argentinian Republic.
In the main document *nos likes in particular -as to #others- the insistence in the need of a coherent approach of the regulation of the network Internet and of the electronic trade and also in the intellectual property, the sale to distance and the protection of data, looks collected, #all *ellos, to protect the rights of the consumers and guarantee suitable norms of feasibility.
Therefore, the goals consist, first, in establishing in #all the European Union and in #all the countries applicants, networks of communication among the organisations that occupy  to struggle against the violence exerted on the women and the boys, as these organisations are the that know the field; second, in creating consciousness among #all the Europeans about the nature of this bad and of the need to eradicate it and to allocate bottoms to *ello.
In this report underlined also the need that we promoted the celebration of an exceptional European Council on the future of the familiar politics and of protection of the infancy in the European Union, and that it presented  to the Parliament a comparative annual report of the legislations of our countries in this subject.
Regarding the amendments, have to say that the European Commission has accepted fully nine, has accepted 7 of *ellas of entrance; but we have not advanced more and it #would want to explain why: During the #finnish Presidency, that as *ustedes know is responsible to boost the complementary directives and the planning of the semester, gave  a strategic option that had communicated  to the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects.
#If there #be not resulted until finals of year, my intention is, in the #portuguese Presidency, introduce a change of strategy, a distinct approximation to the problem and a base of negotiations distinct, to boost said managerial with steps faster and, explaining already with a first reaction of the Council, that the Commission advance in the new approximation, that #would say that it is *algo easy.
More that some words, #would want simply ask, like witness alas very near, that further of the message of compassion -and is truth that the families of the victims will appreciate it- #can, in our quality of Parliament European, initiate a procedure of solidarity by means of helps that #can attribute to this region of the big South so *duramente affected, in favour of the families, first, and afterwards of #that that have lost it all, without embargo also in it that touches to the economic instrument that has remained destroyed.
I share also the point of sight that a just configuration of the budget #can not make exclusively in the side of the income of the budget and share also the opinion that it do not is necessary to expect until the year 2006 to keep a debate on the reform but that it has to make with his support inside this period of term of office.
Also it signals  in this resolution -and is perhaps the most important point, the section 4- that ask this Plenary that approve  the decision to increase the amount of the project of budget *rectificativo and supplementary 599 in 25 millions in credits of payment allocated to the program *PHARE, in consonance, lady *Schreyer, with the urgent needs of this program that *nos has signalled the Commission.
In *Europa have to take our contribution and give good example to the rest of the world, even recognising that the greater pressure for the energetic consumption in the future will owe  to countries like the States Joined, that is quite *despilfarrador in his consumption of energy, and also to the countries in development that, to measure that his economies grow and increase his level of life, go to need a greater energetic consumption, that probably will proceed of sources of energy quite *contaminantes.
The unitary confrontation of the #european citizens on the familiar differences and the questions that accompany to the custody of the boys in case of divorce is clear that go to avert to thousands of families the tiredness and the complications with the bureaucracy and also will reinforce the feeling of security and of confidence of the citizens in the European Union.
These two instruments constitute #one of the first stones of the community building that are building, #whose fundamental goal is the to offer to #all the citizens and to the juridical agents of the Union an easier access, faster and more effective to the justice like *salvaguardia of the norms of security juridical.
Subject: Application of the directive on the nitrates Is conscious the Commission and are it in particular the responsible commissioners of environment and agriculture that the #european directive on the nitrates *91676CEE do not offers absolute guarantees by it that refers  to the quality of the subterranean waters, seen that the directive centres  in the pertinent nitrates of *abonos of animal origin, leaving like this sideways other sources of nitrates?
I do not try to hide the military dimension of the security, but #where more hurts is, to my trial, in this continuous strategy to see  *obnubilada by the military look in detriment of a politics *paneuropea of prevention of the conflicts that was to the measure of the tensions and the fractures of the cold #postwar period in our continent.
We have heard with relief this morning the taking of position very firm of the gentleman #Solana on this subject and the commitment that has assumed to exert #all his influence this afternoon in *Estambul so that in this territory respect  the international right and the of the persons, and with relief finish of *oírle say, gentleman Commissioner *Patten, that will go immediately to add on the terrain his efforts to the of the gentleman #Solana.
It takes fault a European Parliament general legislator of the Union, like the Council, that take part of right plenary in the designation of the members of the other Institutions and able to establish a relation of confidence with the European Commission that no longer will see  weakened by the double majority qualified today necessary for the motion of censorship.
I demand that have true capacity of decision in it referred to the fundamental looks of the common politics of fishing and the regulations of base, for example in the field of the organisation of the market, the conservation and the exploitation of the resources *pesqueros, the measures of control and the instruments of the structural politics. #This calls  *codecisión of the Parliament.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00661999 of the Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the Office of Fight against the Fraud *OLAF.
#One, the speaker of the Commission of Control Budgetary, the Mrs. *Theato, that is a bit the mother of the *OLAF and of #all this regulation; the #another, to the that consider the father of the current regulation, is the Mr. *Napolitano, that has had a big *mesura, a big intelligence and, especially, #a lot of prowess to the hour to confront a difficult solution.
It #would have to be compulsory that there was a greater coherence among the norms that govern the trade, the work, the environment, the animal welfare and other norms of acceptance international and the principles of the fine management of societies by means of a better cooperation among the *OMC, the *OIT, the Nations Joined, the agreements *multilaterales environmental and other international institutions.
#Such as it had required it the president *Pasqua during the general debate that took place in the Plenary at the beginning of October, and as it finishes to remember it *pertinentemente my colleague #Georges *Berthu, before initiating a new cycle of negotiations is indispensable to make a clear and precise balance, goal, therefore independent and contradictory, with the end to perceive the economic consequences, social, environmental and of alimentary security of the previous agreements of the Round *Uruguay.
Under the threat of the delay of the enlargement or even of the dissolution of the Union, by his own creators, in the attempt, without rules neither laws, for conquering new markets and deliver the booty, the capital *monopolista treats to surpass his internal contradictions, that were and follow being important, with #such to serve to the common interest of *sobreexplotar to the workers and obtain the maximum benefit.
In spite of the positive measures that adopted  after the resolution of this Parliament, in the past day 16 September, in particular the entrance of the international strength of peace and security with the *égida of the Nations Joined, the *INTERFET, the situation in matter of humanitarian security follow being grave so much in the territory of *Timor Oriental, #where is essential that get means to support the reconstruction, as in the case of the wall of 250.000 displaced by force to Indonesian, in particular to the western part of *Timor.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the succession of seisms that have seeded the destruction in the northwest of *Turquía *nos has moved to consider essential the reinforcement of the assignments for this country and, therefore, vote *favorablemente, in first reading, a review of the financial perspectives that establishes a support of emergency to *Turquía, to the pair with the priority that concede to the reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
In accordance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00531999 of the Mr. *Medina *Ortega, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, on the proposal of regulation *CE of the Council by the that it modifies  the Regulation *CEE *nº 191191 relative to the application of the disposals of the community Right in the Canarian islands *COM1999 0226 - *C5-01271999 - *19990111CNS
Have known that an American dockyard -that did not build ships from took more of forty years- has received the commission to build two transatlantic fuselages allocated to the service of communication of the islands *Hawai, since the American law reservation to the dockyards of his country the construction of the crafts that make inner transports.
Although it has decided  renounce openly to the dockyards, the most recent events in *Corea of the South #can conduct to that in the Union begin  to confuse the old forms of support to the dockyards and the measures of the guidelines *de1997 #whose goal is not the politics of competition, but simply the of a politics according to the doctrine of the stable development and of *safety *of *the are.
Also I have tried to convince to the aspiring countries of the importance of these subjects *diciéndoles that, although no #all the subjects are in the list of negotiations, #can be that #this wake up so much interest in the Parliaments of the States members, that the best form to ensure  a fast integration is to begin to work with time to resolve these questions, that, nevertheless, will earn big importance *cuando consumes  the adhesion.
I take advantage of this occasion for *pedirle to *usted, to the President of the Parliament, to the Presidency in exercise of the Council, to the Commission, an urgent initiative to take a call to the States Joined so that they suspend the execution of *Derek #Rocco *Bernabei, because the battle against the pity of death is a battle of *civismo that it has to rid always that it was precise and in #all the possible forms.
Finally, it wanted to remember that, #if the relative disposals to the group of the planned helps, comport a finance in three years of 150 millions of euros, the balance in favour of the Union of the commercial scales among *Turquía and the European Union duplicated  from the entrance in vigour the *1º of January of 1996 of the agreement on the Union *Aduanera and in four years happened of four one thousand millions to eight one thousand millions of euros.
Today we have debated with the Presidency in exercise of the Council and with the President of the Commission the problems that pose , the proposals that has taken the European Commission in the frame of his report to the summit of *Helsinki and also regarding the attitude that presumably goes to follow the Council of ministers.
By this reason precisely, not to give a hit to the strengths that struggle today by the democracy, to send a message of solidarity to the *represaliados, a message of pressure by the authentic democratisation of the diet, *les invite to not voting these two proposals, or, at least, to *devolverlas to the Commission, until *Turquía give concrete samples of democratisation and of respect to the international right.
To the sight of the transformations that is experiencing the sylviculture in my country, in the sense of a reduction of the natural spaces, of a massive decrease of the demand of plants and also of a fault of resources public, *me see forced to signal this fact.
Some that the system of payments in great operations has worked very well, whereas -and #all agree- the problem of the excessive commissions in the current moment in the changes is generating a negative environment, because had some expectations of improvement in the cost of the changes of coin during this period, expectation that has not seen  fulfilled.
Also I celebrate that the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer have toughened in his report the requirements regarding that there are data easily accessible and comprehensible of #such form that the public opinion keep  informed in any moment of the quality of the air and of the possible problems of pollution derived of the dangerous broadcasts.
The Liberal give our compliance in the final vote to the common resolution, but affirm to #the same time that has not modified  the position in the question of the reform of the Treaties, of the preparation and execution of the conference *intergubernamental , #such as it has put  of self-evident in his behaviour of vote on the Report *DimitrakopoulosLeinen.
Also there was another reason *circunstancial, the self-evident inability by part of some delegations to engage  with a true process of negotiation of the agenda and, from this point of sight, it is necessary to ask #if it was lucky the coincidence of the inauguration of the conference with the of the beginning of the electoral campaign in the States Joined.
The common fundamental goal to the two programs consists in contributing to the progressive construction of #one *Europa of the knowledge, able to transmit to the youngsters and to the adults the qualifications and the necessary competitions to insert  in the market of the employment and, it that also is important and often forgets , in the society.
The relative measures to the conservation of the populations of fishes and to the control of the activities of the fishing have to be the content of the agreements signed in the frame of the regional organisations of fishing, and these organisations have to fulfil the functions of platform of the international cooperation.
And now, in the moment in that it has given  this step -and it is necessary to remember that the relation with *Turquía did not comes of yesterday, comes of 1963-, *nosotros expect that *Turquía also know to answer of positive way, so much in his process of democratisation internal as also in his relations, no only with the Community, but fundamentally with the country that has given the most important step that believe that it is necessary to hail: #Grecia and his Government.
The achieve affirm the majority like rule in the Community, like base of the political operation of the very important Union for the Parliament in the measure in that we #can *codecidir, the have the juridical personality, the that they include  in the Conference decisions that has taken the Council, as, for example, draft a Letter of rights fundamental... Bear how serve all #this #if it did not includes  in the Treaties?
It is likewise evident, without embargo, that the enlargement in the terms foreseen did not allows neither the immediate realisation of a common external politics neither the definition of a project of politics economic, although this last was extremely urgent, also to the sight of the rise of the dollar with regard to the euro and of the disappointing results of *Seattle.
In said document that traces back to the month of October of this year aims , among other things, that so as to guarantee the global and sustainable competitiveness of the industries of the European Union based in the sylviculture or related with #the same, will be precise to guarantee some surroundings that boost the competition and boost the adaptation of the industry of the European Union to a competition more *aguerrida.
I am not economist, am civil engineer; but I want to underline the exceptional work that the Mr. *Bourlanges and his *coponentes have made, and expect that *nos help in a debate to evaluate notable subjects, to end to be able to judge, with the results in the hand, in how measured materialises the Commission the political decisions expressed in the budgets and did not has, at the end, other pertinent consequences of his application.
Seen that now we have been debating very thoroughly the Budget 2000 and the Parliament wanted to mark some criteria so as to that in the zones affected by the war, as for example in the *Balcanes, make  a planning *plurianual of the finance, #would have to adopt with greater frequency this optics, instead of *dispersarnos excessively in small programs and isolated projects, that do not allow an effective control and that represent some costs of personnel upper to the really necessary for the goals that wish  achieve.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report *A5-00811999 of the Mr. *Valdivielso of *Cué, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of regulation *CE, *Euratom of the relative Council to the granting of assistance to the New Independent States and to *Mongolia in his effort of reform and economic recovery *COM1998 753 - *C4-00381999 - *19980368CNS.
The past week knew  that the Commission, that had to pronounce on a package of helps of the #british Government, thought to answer to this need that the plant purchase a world-wide scope, has *postergado his decision once again, and this delay affects to the confidence of the consumers and to the future of the factory.
*Limitándome To the last events in the Council, the #finnish Presidency has prepared a form directed to #all the countries members and to #all the #european institutions on the subject The women in the processes of decision #whose answers have made possible to the #finnish Presidency the editorial of a report that contains nine indicators and #some recommendations.
- Report *A5-00881999 of the Mr. #Miranda, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, on the communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course to 1 May 1999 in the field of the development and of the cooperation *SEC1999 581 - *C4-02191999 Confirmation of the first reading: *COM1994 289 - *C4-00901994 - *19940167COD - ancient *19940167SYN
Now *nos gets the news that the connection of the computer system of the European Parliament in *Bruselas with Internet will not be available among 22 December and on 4 January: #this involves for the #european deputies the prohibition, the absolute impossibility to work among 22 December and on 4 January in his dispatches in *Bruselas.
It #can indicate the Council #if it has posed  this subject during the contacts among the EU and the countries that have expressed his wish of *ingresar in the Union? How measured thinks to propose with the end that it limit  the uncontrolled flow of economic refugees to the EU, that has clear secondary effects of economic and social type for example, increase of the criminality in his States members?
On the other hand, #if the Community endorses with his true budgets types of credits of the European Bank of Investments, for example, the credits of projects that make  in third countries, the Council has stipulated that in these cases the *BEI has to deliver an annual report, so much to the European Parliament as to the Council, on the measures that have carried out with the credits endorsed by the budgets.
According to the article 255 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community, the Council and the Parliament, in a term of two years after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, have to ratify in procedure of *codecisión the general principles on the access to the documents and the pertinent limitations in plough of the private interest or public.
Then, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fishing will be able to take into account, with *algo of fine will by his part our amendments and adopt the legal text to the sight of #the same, Propose that we vote on the Report *Papayannakis and that *usted choose the sharpest feather that have in his arsenal and write to the Council in name of the Parliament, with the hope that the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fishing no pass without more by #alto it that agreed  yesterday, but that take into account our amendments.
It is not *usted of agreement *conmigo in that the absence of a price *transfronterizo *vinculante, or well his suppression, comports, especially for the small companies -and with *ello go back to the subject of the employment-, the risk that the national systems remain without effect owing to the big volume of the imports; the risk of disappearance of the small bookshops, especially in the half rural and in the small cities, and that with *ello reduce  the accessibility?
And *nos find precisely in this debate. Thus *le invite to define with clarity the notable market in this context like a linguistic and cultural space; to that it clear the existence of the clause of import beside the possibility to dictate a rule to national level, and to that it resort to the #french Right in his decision and in his considerations.
From the point of sight of the Commission, only will be able to surpass the regional tensions and the claims of greater autonomy or of independence #if in Indonesian establishes  a diet, a system that guarantee sure enough a clear political responsibility and the transparency in the direction of the State and that fulfil the wishes of the big majority of the citizens and citizen, of clear democratic ascription.
In the future years, the alimentary security of our *conciudadanos will depend fundamentally of the way in that the new Commission know to defend, in the course of the next negotiations of the round of the #Millenium, the full legitimacy of a model of zone #european distinct with an upper agricultural quality.
But also I affirm that *me seems absurd that the States members that in the past, by general norm, do not have  *atenido never to #european norms of security, want to forbid like general norm the animal flour; or that now the Commission take a general question of the utilisation of the rests of food in a document of work on purpose of the utilisation of oils and fats.
The second inform of the Committee of Experts Independent *nos helps in the guidelines, #many of the *cuales already appeared in the indications of the Parliament and *usted same has anticipated with clear commitments like the of the new criteria for the training of the cabinets and of a greater transparency in the relations with the European Parliament and with the public opinion.
Finally, the rage of the Mrs. Of Palace in the tyre of press back to the audition no *augura swims good for somebody among #whose competitions include  the relations with the European Parliament and, although I recognise that the Mrs. Of Palace  *disculpó later by his observations, awake without new embargo doubts about his capacity to exert this concrete charge in the breast of the new Commission.
We admit that the commissioners subjected to the trial of the Parliament, to judge by the audiences and by the statement today of the Mr. *Prodi, have, individual and collectively, of the capacity and the necessary resolution to serve faithful and *inquebrantablemente to the goals of the European Union, in detriment of the interests of the group of the workers and of the villages of *Europa.
We #can not ignore the challenges of the globalisation to the that at present it confronts  the Union, the peak of the audiovisual sector and of the society of the information, the need of an educational capacity of big *calado and amplitude and, finally, the need to establish the legitimacy of our institutions and give new vigour to his forms.
Of face to this preparatory meeting that will take place in *Turku tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and had account of the increasing presence in *Europa, by misfortune, of the delinquency organised, of the criminality related with the world of the drugs, of the traffic of human beings and of other similar offences, *me seemed incomprehensible that this House  *enzarzara in a discussion about #if it suits or not opening a debate on this question here in the European Parliament.
Likewise, the participation of the States members in the council of administration will allow to guarantee that a time that the Commission have decided the annual program, #all the other relative decisions to the projects take  on the terrain, without going back to resort to the committee of management formed by the States members in *Bruselas.
The absence of an independent electoral commission, the absence of a just access to the media, the absence of guarantees to be able to carry out an electoral campaign, have conducted to the opposition, majority, to boycott the legislative elections of the spring.
The total liberalisation *indiscriminada, #such as it has carried out in *Alemania, already is creating a difficult situation bear to the projects of *aprovechamiento of the biomass and also for the projects of energy solar. In the social field, is evident that early will give place to #a lot of cases, of lower dimensions, like the of *Michelin , because of the suppression *racionalizadora of employments to take go up the *cotización in bag of the energetic companies.
I have to say, gentleman President, that the *primer program *ALTENER and more advance the white Book on the renewable energies, that has developed the community strategy and the plan of action for the year 2010, have been possible graces, insist once again, to the collaboration among our two institutions, Parliament and Commission, and that the new politics of the European Union in matter of renewable energies has built  precisely thanks to the good understanding among *nosotros.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-001599 of the Mrs. *Ahern, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that approves  a program *plurianual of promotion of the energetic efficiency *SAVE 1998-2002 7123199 - *C5-003399 - *970371COD.
It is not precise to resort to the figures of exchanges commercial, investment and cooperation to the development to deduce the weight of the European Union in the region, but the tested economic solidarity of the European Union has to be so valued like his capacity to contribute effectively to a peaceful solution of the conflict.
Why we do not take to see to *Turquía that his recognition like country candidate to the adhesion constitutes the exception of what have demanded to the other countries as for example, to *Eslovaquia and that this exception takes  by special reasons that #would have to refer with clarity..., for *facilitarle the progress to the regulations demanded; and that his course the will be observing the European Parliament and that, at the end, #this will judge his real appeal to the adhesion to the European Union?
On the other hand, our society is legitimately concerned by the challenges that the phenomenon of the globalisation *nos poses: the respect of the human rights and of the fundamental social freedoms, the protection of the environment and the preservation of the nature, #as well as the protection of the health of our consumers.
With the solemn Statement of the month of June of 1998 the 174 countries members of the World-wide Organisation of the Work engaged  to promote the four fundamental rights of the work: the right of association, the respect of the labour minimum age, the prohibition of the works *forzosos and the no discrimination.
In the frame of the current agreement of the common position, the requirement of the amendment *nº 5, to know, create a directive of the EU with some goals *jurídicamente *vinculantes for the renewable energies, is the minimum previous condition so that the document #can be taken seriously at least of an approximate mood.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading *A5-00281999 of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position approved by the Council *COM93 646 - *C5-00301999 - *19940011COD with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the facilities of transport of persons by wire Speaker: Mr. *Miller.
Having present that the own Defender the Village of the Government of *Colombia informs of a massacre by each day of this year and that the Commission of Jurists Colombian attributes the 78% of #the same to the *paramilitares, with the knowledge of the #colombian official strengths, #can *usted occupy, like President of this Parliament, that during his private conversations talk  of the subject of the human rights?
The first is to give the graces once again to the Mr. *Duisenberg for ensuring to this Assembly that the process of cooperation among the #ECB and the national central banks is now sufficient, even in the case of a grave crisis in the that a financial institution of the zone of the euro #can need support.
From this point of sight is a provocation for the feel democratic of the villages that the European Parliament consider an advance the fact that they give , with regularity, conferences of press after the meetings of the Council of Government of the #ECB or the fact that, apart from the annual report publish  monthly reports of the Central Bank European.
#This has to be the signal so that the great political strategies, budgetary and monetary do not pose  always according to the approach of the one who sees the novelty of an only coin, but of the one who has to take into account the long term to give stability to the euro and to the States members, and especially to reactivate the economy of the Union and the chapter of the employment that so much *nos concerns to #all in this Parliament.
Like this, it is necessary that there #be another form of intervention of the #ECB and an effective democratic control of his operation and that in the #european politics concede  priority to the resolution of the economic and social problems of the European Union and of his States members, in particular the politics of growth and creation of employment.
In the first place, it is necessary to encourage and boost to the #european citizens, the associations and the small #european companies of the sector, to benefit  of this program it more possible averting concentrate the already scarce finances only in #few great events, in benefit of some those that privileged networks that, in the long run, as *nos teaches the previous experience, finish for having the monopoly of said finances; second, it #would be timely to take all it possible to increase the planned financial endowment for this program.
I consider that the Parliament, in the moment in that it approves a measure of this type, offers a big opening to the #turkish youngsters that complaining of the errors of his parents, #can watch to *Europa like a reality of big freedom, like a union of States in the *cuales the culture, his diffusion and the solidarity among the youngsters are important and fundamental elements.
By this reason and to end to guarantee a high grade of security in the so much national transport like international and eradicate the distortions of the competition, the European Union adopted the Directive 9649 on the approximation of the legislations of the States relative members to the transport of commodities dangerous by railway.
And that constitutes a reason of pride particular, since this prize carries the name of a scientist, *Andrei *Sajarov, that subjected his prestige to hard proofs of #all type to struggle by the freedom of the villages of the countries of the East against #one of the most #hideous forms of totalitarianism that has known this century.
But I #can comprise part of the anger that feel the graziers and the consumers of Big *Bretaña *cuando  *enteran that they have found  silts *cloacales in the *piensos that employ  in *Francia, *cuando  *enteran that the #british Government knew #this from the month of June but decided not touching the subject in the European Commission, and *cuando  *enteran that in the Realm Joined still sacrifice 60.000 heads of livestock because have more of 30 months of age and #can not go in in the alimentary chain, although they are animal perfectly healthy.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, #would suit *usted *conmigo in that it results very surprising that #some States members ask now new explanations and additional explanations *cuando #this already debated  during a year and half with these same States members in the Permanent Veterinary Committee? And it #would suit *usted *conmigo in that the States members that keep the prohibition of the imports #would have to present new scientific data or of it contrary only give the impression of that they want to follow postponing until a distant future the realisation of the only market?
Lady Speaker, want to signal that the dialogue *macroeconómico forms part of the complex process of the pact of the employment and that, as it has exposed well the Presidency in exercise of the Council, is consequence of the decisions of Colony, trying, by means of the establishment of this dialogue among social and responsible speakers of the economic politics and budgetary politics with participation also of the Central Bank European, achieve the goals that, at the end, pretend.
We #can begin to abandon concepts like #that? We #can begin maybe to adopt a more realistic opinion in the fixation of the types of interest, with it that #would recognise  the change of the conditions, by it that now #can begin to contain the increases of the types of interest, to measure that diminishes the unemployment, not to suffocate a fragile growth?
Definitely, in his common position the Council has adopted #some important points as, for example, the compulsory implantation of values limit in two stages, a greater requirement on the durability of the squads of control of broadcasts in the commercial vehicles weighed and buses, a system of #diagnosis *on.*board, a control of field.
Although my Group #would have put *gustosamente other accents *algo different in #some points of the program *DAPHNE, for example the connection with other community programs as *PHARE, *TACIS and *MEDA, because in #this there #be big quantity of resources to set up in the countries preventive measured candidates and campaigns, agree with the Mrs. *Avilés regarding reaching a fast consensus and avert a procedure of conciliation, and recommend only six amendments to the common position.
The Commission will ensure specifically that this program was a notable road to pipe the synergies of the public authorities and of the *ONG to conserve the physical and psychic integrity and the social welfare of the boys, the teenagers and the women in #all the fields of activity.
*Ellas Express better of it that #would take it *yo the way in that the boys are excluded of the politics of the European Union and in that the laws and the politics that takes the European Union have a very real impact in the lives of the boys, an impact that is not #the same that have in the lives of the adults.
At present, this subject is in the centre of a political debate very lit in my country and *me seems totally inopportune, by not saying, inadmissible that our Speaker, given his institutional position, support so ardently to #one of the parts involved and besides ignore that an article of the #italian Constitution refers  on purpose to the freedom to open centres of education deprived without costs for the State.
#If I use a very critical tone, do not take it fundamentally against *usted, lady *Schreyer, as *usted has not been the responsible person during the last weeks, but #if like Parliament at the end of a year, in autumn, elaborate a budget, then split of the fact that in this budget determine some priorities and that these priorities are also the that in the course of procedure budgetary apply  really, *surten effects and expect that it that consider important apply  also really in form of politics.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate on the report *A5-00391999 of the Mr. *Chichester, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council *COM1998 571 - *C4-00401999 and to the European Parliament Promotion of the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the energetic politics of the Community .
Gentleman President, this proposal that will resolve -like this expect it- by means of a community regulation the difficulties that find the citizens and the families to consequence of the fault of recognition of the judicial decisions on the end of the matrimonial bond and the exercise of the homeland authority deserves our applause and our charm.
Regarding the amendment *nº 11 -and expect to that formulate  a new oral proposal to be able to *pronunciarme on the new version-, *cuando forces to take into account the interests of the boys, *nos seems that it opens the door for a trial -regarding the bottom by part of the State that has to receive the judicial decision- that do not has fit in the frame of this type of instrument.
The Commission is commissioned also of the execution of the program *STOP, #whose goal is the to give the necessary training and information to the professionals, in particular to the judges, to the services of police and to the services of assistance social, in the fight against the traffic of human beings and the sexual exploitation of women.
Regarding the group of high level, #if the Commission and the Council approve it -as I already have said, the Commission will take it predictably the next day 24 of this month, the Council on 6 December-, the pretence #would be that this group of high level began to work to first of the month of February or even to finals of the month of January.
An international rule in matter of competition has to establish some minimum norms that prevent contrary behaviours to the competition, like the creation of cartels for the control of the prices or the cast of zones, the abuse of position dominant or vertical restrictions and horizontals of the competition, #all the *cuales distort the competition.
The attacks against columns of refugees and zones inhabited, the closing of the borders and the fetters to the performance of the international organisations of help that loan humanitarian help, no only contravene in #all the cases the Convention of Gin on protection of the civil population in the zones in war and other international commitments, but that they are performances simply inhuman and of the all unacceptable.
The norms that regulate the international economic relations and the trade have to respect the fundamental social rights, have to serve to the interests of the workers, contribute to the development of the less developed countries, respect the environment and create the necessary conditions for the development of #all the villages.
We have considered, in base to the Statement of Colony, that the works *preparativos have to concentrate, in the practice, in three particular points: the size and the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the votes in the Council and the extension of the qualified majority; in addition to these three points, also will treat  institutional questions related closely with #the same.
The amendment 18 of my Group, that requests that the Parliament was consulted on the annual economic orientations, the decisions that concern to the budgetary deficits and #all another important decision that have to take  in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union, leaving, of course, to a side the independence of the Central Bank European.
To #the same time, also wanted to *replicarle to the Mrs. *Kaufmann, that finishes to quote to the newspaper of the enemy of class, *Die *Welt , that the party to the that *ella belonged has been the only #german party that has summoned to a war of aggression after the *Segunda World-wide War, specifically against *Checoslovaquia, and to the sight of *ello, #would have to abstain to take comments like the that finishes to pronounce.
Subject: political Prisoners in *Myanmar #Can the Speaker in exercise of the Council inform on #all the celebrated debates and the decisions adopted recently by the Council of Ministers of External Subjects in relation with the politics followed by the EU regarding *Myanmar and, in particular, on the possibility to achieve of the Government of this country an amnesty for the political prisoners?
#If we do not approve today the report *nos will find in an unsustainable situation, as only the deputies of the European Parliament #would be above the law to #that *respecto: a text that applies  in the Council by the same to the politicians and civil servants, in the Commission by the same to the politicians and civil servants, #would apply  in the Parliament only to our civil servants and no to the deputies of the European Parliament.
The best demonstration, anyway, of #which is the security that promotes  is the own Treaty of *Amsterdam, the incorporation of it already achieved in *Schengen, the creation of some community police, the police #index card of the citizens by his political convictions, his ideological orientation, his #sindical action, even by his loving relations.
*Me Seems that the Mrs. *Giannakou has taken a big effort for adopting a posture of consensus concerning the Plan of action, directed to integrate the different perspectives that there #be no only among the different *filiaciones political, but also among the different national traditions, to integrate also the different looks of the question and the diverse and in contradictory part interests.
Therefore, *me #would enjoy that my explanations went satisfactory, that the Parliament #can reconsider his requests, that gave  the maximum urgency to the acceptance of this decision with the guarantee that, #if in the future there were problems from the point of sight financial, the Commission will pose the need to go more far regarding the Bottom of reservation..
